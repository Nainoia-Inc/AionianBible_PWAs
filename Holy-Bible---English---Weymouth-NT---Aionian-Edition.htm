<p>This a Progressive Web App (PWA) format of one <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>. PWAs are special webpages designed to install an App icon and be available offline on a smart device if an Internet connection is not available. Visit <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Read' target='_blank' title='Select from all AionianBible.org translations'>AionianBible.org</a> for all Bibles.</p>

<p>The  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>  is the world’s first Bible <i>un-translation</i>!  What is an  <i>un-translation</i>?  Bibles are translated into each of our languages from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.  Occasionally, the best word translation cannot be found and these words are transliterated letter by letter.  Four well known transliterations are  <i>Christ</i>,  <i>baptism</i>,  <i>angel</i>, and  <i>apostle</i>.  The meaning is then preserved more accurately through context and a dictionary.  The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible un-translates and instead transliterates eleven additional <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>The first three words are  <a href="?Glossary#g165" title="Aionian glossary g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g166" title="Aionian glossary g166" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g166');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g126" title="Aionian glossary g126" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g126');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i></a>,  typically translated as  <i>eternal</i>  and also  <i>world</i>  or  <i>eon</i>. The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible is named after an alternative spelling of  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>. Consider that researchers question if  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  and  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  actually mean <i>eternal</i>. Translating  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  as <i>eternal</i> in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-28'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-28');		return false;">Matthew 28:20</a>  makes no sense, as all agree. The Greek word for eternal is  <i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i>, used in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-1'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-1');			return false;">Romans 1:20</a>  about God and in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>  about demon imprisonment. Yet what about  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>? Certainly we do not question whether salvation is eternal! However,  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  means something much more wonderful than infinite time! Ancient Greeks used  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  to mean eon or age. They also used the adjective  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  to mean entirety, such as  <i>complete</i>  or even <i>consummate</i>, but never infinite time. Read <a href="?Aionian" title="Aiōn and Aiōnios" onclick="ABDO('Aionian');return false;">Dr. Heleen Keizer and Ramelli and Konstan</a> for proofs. So  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  is the perfect description of God's Word which has  <i>everything</i>  we need for life and godliness! And the  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  life promised in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>  is not simply a ticket to eternal life in the future, but the invitation through faith to the  <i>consummate</i>  life beginning now!  <i class='notranslate'>Aiōnios</i>  life with Christ is <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Buy#Better' target='_blank'><i>Better than Forever</i></a>.</p>

<p>The next seven words are  <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041 g4442" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i></a>. These words are often translated as  <i>Hell</i>, the place of eternal punishment. However,  <i>Hell</i>  is ill-defined when compared with the Hebrew and Greek.  For example,  <i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i>  is the abode of deceased believers and unbelievers and should never be translated as  <i>Hell</i>.  <i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i>  is a temporary place of punishment,  <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i>  is the Valley of Hinnom, Jerusalem's refuse dump, a temporal judgment for sin.  <i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i>  is a prison for demons, mentioned once in  <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i>  is a temporary prison for the Beast and Satan. Translators are also inconsistent because  <i>Hell</i>  is used by the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---King-James-Version' target='_blank' title='King James Version'>King James Version</a>  54 times, the  <a href='https://www.thenivbible.com/' target='_blank' title='New International Version Bible'>New International Version</a>  14 times, and the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---World-English-Bible' target='_blank' title='World English Bible'>World English Bible</a>  zero times.  Finally,  <i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i>  is the Lake of Fire, yet  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>  explains that these fires are  <a href="?Destiny" title="Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels" onclick="ABDO('Destiny');return false;">prepared for the Devil and his angels</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The eleventh word,  <a href="?Glossary#g1653" title="Aionian glossary g1653" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1653');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>eleēsē</i></a>, reveals the grand conclusion of grace in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-11'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-11');		return false;">Romans 11:32</a>. Take the time to understand these eleven words.  The original translation is unaltered and a highlighted note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses.  Also to help parallel study and <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Enhanced Concordance</a> use, apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard.

<p>Dr. Heleen Keizer wrote <b><i>Life Time Entirety</i></b> to explain the meaning of the Greek word aiōn. She begins, "<i>The Greek word aiōn has a wide ranging meaning as well as a wide ranging history: it is most commonly translated as ‘eternity’ but has as its first meaning ‘life’ or ‘lifetime’; it has its place in Greek literature and philosophy, but also in the Greek Bible, where it represents the Hebrew word ‘olâm.</i>" Her 315 page PhD dissertation shows that the Greek word aiōn originally denotes life time, duration, or complete life, but not eternal. You can read her <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer' target='_blank' title='Visit Dr. Keizers dissertation online'>dissertation online</a> or an <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer-Abstract' target='_blank' title='View an abstract of Dr. Keizers dissertation'>abstract of her conclusions here</a>.</p>

<p>Ilaria Ramelli and David Konstan wrote <b><i>Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts</i></b>, <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Terms-for-Eternity-Ramelli-Konstan' target='_blank' title='Purchase Ramelli and Konstan at Amazon.com'>available at Amazon</a>. This highly technical volume quotes hundreds of sources from classical literature, the Septuagint, early church fathers, and church fathers after Origen to determine the meaning and usage of <i>Aiōnios</i> and <i>Aïdios</i>.  They conclude that <i>Aïdios</i> nearly always means eternal in the absolute sense.  <i>Aïdios</i> is used twice in the Bible: Romans 1:20 concerning God and Jude 6 concerning the bonds on fallen angels.  <i>Aiōnios</i>, however, has a range of meanings including life, age, generation, and eon.  They argue that <i>Aiōnios</i> can also mean eternal, but only when God is the subject.  Ramelli and Konstan concur with Keizer and conclude saying, "<i>Needless to say, the ethical implications of this question are profound.</i>"</p>

<p>Every quest for the truth must have the wisdom to eliminate what we prefer to be true and also the courage to eliminate what we fear to be true in order to discover what Christ says is actually true.</p>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He left them, and went away once more and prayed a third time, again using the same words.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He came to the disciples and said, "Sleep on and rest. See, the moment is close at hand when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>63 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus however remained silent. Again the High Priest addressed Him.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>64 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"I am He," replied Jesus. "But I tell you that, later on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Omnipotence, and coming on the clouds of the sky."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>65 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the High Priest tore his robes and exclaimed, "Impious language! What further need have we of witnesses! See, you have now heard the impiety.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>67 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they spat in His face, and struck Him--some with the fist, some with the open hand--</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>68 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >while they taunted Him, saying, "Christ, prove yourself a Prophet by telling us who it was that struck you."</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>74 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then with curses and oaths he declared, "I do not know the man." Immediately a cock crowed,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then summoning the Twelve to Him, He proceeded to send them out by twos, and gave them authority over the foul spirits.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He charged them to take nothing for the journey except a stick; no bread, no bag, and not a penny in their pockets,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when He saw them distressed with rowing (for the wind was against them), towards morning He came towards them walking on the Lake, as if intending to pass them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They saw Him walking on the water, and thinking that it was a spirit they cried out;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for they all saw Him and were terrified. He, however, immediately spoke to them. "There is no danger," He said; "it is I; be not alarmed."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He went up to them on board the boat, and the wind lulled; and they were beside themselves with silent amazement.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Having crossed over they drew to land in Gennesaret and came to anchor.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But no sooner had they gone ashore than the people immediately recognized Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they scoured the whole district, and began to bring Him the sick on their mats wherever they heard He was.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And enter wherever He might--village or town or hamlet--they laid their sick in the open places, and entreated Him to let them touch were it but the tassel of His robe; and all, whoever touched Him, were restored to health.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and certain women whom He had delivered from evil spirits and various diseases--Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons had come,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many other women, all of whom contributed to the support of Jesus and His Apostles.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And when a great crowd was assembling, and was receiving additions from one town after another, He spoke a parable to them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"The sower," He said, "goes out to sow his seed; and as he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and is trodden upon, or the birds of the air come and peck it up.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Another part drops upon the rock, and after growing up it withers away for want of moisture.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But some of the seed falls into good ground, and grows up and yields a return of a hundred for one." While thus speaking, He cried aloud and said, "Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The disciples proceeded to ask Him what this parable meant.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"To you," He replied, "it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God; but all others are taught by parables, in order that they may see and yet not see, and may hear and yet not understand.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The meaning of the parable is as follows. The seed is God's Message.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Those by the way-side are those who have heard, and then the Devil comes and carries away the Message from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Those on the rock are the people who on hearing the Message receive it joyfully; but they have no root: for a time they believe, but when trial comes they fall away.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >That which fell among the thorns means those who have heard, but as they go on their way, the Message is stifled by the anxieties, wealth and gaieties of time, and they yield nothing in perfection.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But as for that in the good ground, it means those who, having listened to the Message with open minds and in a right spirit, hold it fast, and patiently yield a return.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"When any one lights a lamp, he does not cover it with a vessel or hide it under a couch; he puts it on a lampstand, that people who enter the room may see the light.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There is nothing hidden, which shall not be openly seen; nor anything secret, which shall not be known and come into the light of day.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Be careful, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has anything, to him more shall be given, and whoever has nothing, even that which he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then came to Him His mother and His brothers, but could not get near Him for the crowd.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But He was told, "Your mother and brothers are standing on the edge of the crowd, and want to see you."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"My mother and my brothers," He replied, "are these who hear God's Message and obey it."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >One day He went on board a boat--both He and his disciples; and He said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the Lake." So they set sail.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >During the passage He fell asleep, and there came down a squall of wind on the Lake, so that the boat began to fill and they were in deadly peril.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they came and woke Him, crying, "Rabbi, Rabbi, we are drowning." Then He roused Himself and rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased and there was a calm.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"Where is your faith?" He asked them. But they were filled with terror and amazement, and said to one another, "Who then is this? for He gives orders both to wind and waves, and they obey Him."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they put in to shore in the country of the Gerasenes, which lies opposite to Galilee.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Here, on landing, He was met by one of the townsmen who was possessed by demons--for a long time he had not put on any garment, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? Do not torture me, I beseech you."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For already He had been commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. For many a time it had seized and held him, and they had repeatedly put him in chains and fetters and kept guard over him, but he used to break the chains to pieces, and, impelled by the demon, to escape into the Desert.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"What is your name?" Jesus asked him. "Legion," he replied--because a great number of demons had entered into him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex avh' lang='en' >and they besought Him not to command them to be gone into the Bottomless Pit. <span class='not' dir='ltr'><a href='?50' onclick='ABDO(50);return false;' title='View previous annotation'>&lt;</a> Abyssos <a href="?Glossary#g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');	return false;"	title='View definition'>g12</a> <a href='?59' onclick='ABDO(59);return false;' title='View next annotation'>&gt;</a></span></span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now there was a great herd of swine there feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Him to give them leave to go into them, and He gave them leave.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The demons came out of the man and left him, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed violently over the cliff into the Lake and were drowned.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The swineherds, seeing what had happened, fled and reported it both in town and country;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >whereupon the people came out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were terrified.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And those who had seen it told them how the demoniac was cured.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the whole population of the Gerasenes and of the adjacent districts begged Him to depart from them; for their terror was great. So He went on board and returned.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the man from whom the demons had gone out earnestly asked permission to go with Him; but He sent him away.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"Return home," He said, "and tell there all that God has done for you." So he went and published through the whole town all that Jesus had done for him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when Jesus was returning, the people gave Him a warm welcome; for they had all been looking out for Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Just then there came a man named Jair, a Warden of the Synagogue, who threw himself at the feet of Jesus, and entreated Him to come to his house;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as He went, the dense throng crowded on Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage--and had spent on doctors all she had, but none of them had been able to cure her--</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >came close behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe; and instantly her flow of blood stopped.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"Who is it touched me?" Jesus asked. And when all denied having done so, Peter and the rest said, "Rabbi, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing on you."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"Some one has touched me," Jesus replied, "for I feel that power has gone out from me."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the woman, perceiving that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and throwing herself down at His feet she stated before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was instantly cured.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"Daughter," said He, "your faith has cured you; go, and be at peace."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While He was still speaking, some one came to the Warden of the Synagogue from his house and said, "Your daughter is dead; trouble the Rabbi no further."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus heard the words and said to him, "Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored to life."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He came to the house, but allowed no one to go in with Him but Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The people were all weeping aloud and beating their breasts for her; but He said, "Leave off wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And they jeered at Him, knowing that she was dead.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He, however, took her by the hand and called aloud, "Child, awake!"</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And her spirit returned, and instantly she stood up; and He directed them to give her some food.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Her parents were astounded; but He forbad them to mention the matter to any one.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the owner of the vineyard said, "'What am I to do? I will send my son--my dearly-loved son: they will probably respect him.'</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Pilate gave Him up to them to be crucified. Accordingly they took Jesus;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Here he found a Jew, a native of Pontus, of the name of Aquila. He and his wife Priscilla had recently come from Italy because of Claudius's edict expelling all the Jews from Rome. So Paul paid them a visit;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and because he was of the same trade--that of tent-maker--he lodged with them and worked with them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, Sabbath after Sabbath, he preached in the synagogue and tried to win over both Jews and Greeks.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now at the time when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was preaching fervently and was solemnly telling the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But upon their opposing him with abusive language, he shook his clothes by way of protest, and said to them, "Your ruin will be upon your own heads. I am not responsible: in future I will go among the Gentiles."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he left the place and went to the house of a person called Titius Justus, a worshipper of the true God. His house was next door to the synagogue.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Crispus, the Warden of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, and so did all his household; and from time to time many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and received baptism.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, in a vision by night, the Lord said to Paul, "Dismiss your fears: go on speaking, and do not give up.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I am with you, and no one shall attack you to injure you; for I have very many people in this city."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Paul remained in Corinth for a year and six months, teaching among them the Message of God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when Gallio became Proconsul of Greece, the Jews with one accord made a dead set at Paul, and brought him before the court.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"This man," they said, "is inducing people to offer unlawful worship to God."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when Paul was about to begin his defence, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it had been some wrongful act or piece of cunning knavery I might reasonably have listened to you Jews.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But since these are questions about words and names and your Law, you yourselves must see to them. I refuse to be a judge in such matters."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he ordered them out of court.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the people all set upon Sosthenes, the Warden of the synagogue, and beat him severely in front of the court. Gallio did not concern himself in the least about this.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After remaining a considerable time longer in Corinth, Paul took leave of the brethren and set sail for Syria; and Priscilla and Aquila were with him.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They put in at Ephesus, and there Paul left his companions behind. As for himself, he went to the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they asked him to remain longer he did not consent,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but took leave of them with the promise, "I will return to you, God willing." So he set sail from Ephesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Landing at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and inquired after the welfare of the Church, and then went down to Antioch.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out on a tour, visiting the whole of Galatia and Phrygia in order, and strengthening all the disciples.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria, a man of great learning and well versed in the Scriptures.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He had been instructed by word of mouth in the way of the Lord, and, being full of burning zeal, he used to speak and teach accurately the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John's.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Priscilla and Aquila, after hearing him, took him home and explained God's way to him more accurately.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, as he had made up his mind to cross over into Greece, the brethren wrote to the disciples in Corinth begging them to give him a kindly welcome.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for he powerfully and in public overcame the Jews in argument, proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you first believed?" he asked them. "No," they replied, "we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit."</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >"John," he said, "administered a baptism of repentance, bidding the people believe on One who was to come after him; namely, on Jesus."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and when Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They numbered in all about twelve men.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Afterwards he went into the synagogue. There for three months he continued to preach fearlessly, explaining in words which carried conviction the truths which concern the Kingdom of God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But some grew obstinate in unbelief and spoke evil of the new faith before all the congregation.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of the province of Asia, Jews as well as Greeks, heard the Lord's Message.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >God also brought about extraordinary miracles through Paul's instrumentality.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But there were also some wandering Jewish exorcists who undertook to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, "I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew of high-priestly family, who were doing this.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them, over-mastered them both, and treated them with such violence, that they fled from the house stripped of their clothes and wounded.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >All the people of Ephesus, Jews as well as Greeks, came to know of this. There was widespread terror, and they began to hold the name of the Lord Jesus in high honour.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Many also of those who believed came confessing without reserve what their conduct had been,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Thus mightily did the Lord's Message spread and triumph!</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now just at that time there arose no small commotion about the new faith.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There was a certain Demetrius, a silversmith, who made miniature silver sanctuaries of Diana, a business which brought great gain to the mechanics in his employ.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There is danger, therefore, not only that this our trade will become of no account, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will fall into utter disrepute, and that before long she will be actually deposed from her majestic rank--she who is now worshipped by the whole province of Asia; nay, by the whole world."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After listening to this harangue, they became furiously angry and kept calling out, "Great is the Ephesian Diana!"</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The riot and uproar spread through the whole city, till at last with one accord they rushed into the Theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were fellow travellers with Paul.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Paul would have liked to go in and address the people, but the disciples would not let him do so.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >A few of the public officials, too, who were friendly to him, sent repeated messages entreating him not to venture into the Theatre.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The people, meanwhile, kept shouting, some one thing and some another; for the assembly was all uproar and confusion, and the greater part had no idea why they had come together.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then some of the people crowded round Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand to get silence, was prepared to make a defence to the people.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >No sooner, however, did they see that he was a Jew, than there arose from them all one roar of shouting, lasting about two hours. "Great is the Ephesian Diana," they said.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >At length the Recorder quieted them down. "Men of Ephesus," he said, "who is there of all mankind that needs to be told that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Zeus?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >These facts, then, being unquestioned, it becomes you to maintain your self-control and not act recklessly.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >If, however, Demetrius and the mechanics who support his contention have a grievance against any one, there are Assize-days and there are Proconsuls: let the persons interested accuse one another.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But if you desire anything further, it will have to be settled in the regular assembly.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For in connexion with to-day's proceedings there is danger of our being charged with attempted insurrection, there having been no real reason for this riot; nor shall we be able to justify the behaviour of this disorderly mob."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >With these words he dismissed the assembly.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It took several days of slow sailing for us to come with difficulty off Cnidus; from which point, as the wind did not allow us to get on in the direct course, we ran under the lee of Crete by Salmone.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, coasting along with difficulty, we reached a place called 'Fair Havens,' near the town of Lasea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Our voyage thus far had occupied a considerable time, and the navigation being now unsafe and the Fast also already over, Paul warned them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Julius let himself be persuaded by the pilot and by the owner rather than by Paul's arguments;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and as the harbour was inconvenient for wintering in, the majority were in favour of putting out to sea, to try whether they could get to Phoenix--a harbour on the coast of Crete facing north-east and south-east--to winter there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And a light breeze from the south sprang up, so that they supposed they were now sure of their purpose. So weighing anchor they ran along the coast of Crete, hugging the shore.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But it was not long before a furious north-east wind, coming down from the mountains, burst upon us and carried the ship out of her course.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >She was unable to make headway against the gale; so we gave up and let her drive.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then we ran under the lee of a little island called Cauda, where we managed with great difficulty to secure the boat;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, after hoisting it on board, they used frapping-cables to undergird the ship, and, as they were afraid of being driven on the Syrtis quicksands, they lowered the gear and lay to.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But now take courage, for there will be no destruction of life among you, but of the ship only.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It was now the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Sea of Adria, when, about midnight, the sailors suspected that land was close at hand.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I therefore strongly advise you to take some food. This is essential for your safety. For not a hair will perish from the head of any one of you."</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This raised the spirits of all, and they too took food.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There were 276 of us, crew and passengers, all told.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After eating a hearty meal they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When daylight came, they tried in vain to recognise the coast.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea, unloosing at the same time the bands which secured the paddle-rudders. Then, hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But coming to a place where two seas met, they stranded the ship, and her bow sticking fast remained immovable, while the stern began to go to pieces under the heavy hammering of the sea.</span></span>

<p>The Aionian Bible republishes public domain and Creative Common Bible texts that are 100% free to copy and print. The original translation is unaltered and notes are added to help your study. The notes show the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>Who has the authority to interpret the Bible and examine the underlying Hebrew and Greek words? That is a good question! We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:27</a>, <i>"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."</i> Every Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible! Now that does not mean we will all agree. Each of us is still growing in our understanding of the truth. However, it does mean that there is no infallible human or tradition to answer all our questions. Instead the Holy Spirit helps each of us to know the truth and grow closer to God and each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is a library with 66 books in the Protestant Canon. The best way to learn God’s word is to read entire books. Read the book of Genesis. Read the book of <a title='View Reference' href='?John'				onclick="ABDO('John');				return false;">John</a>. Read the entire Bible library. Topical studies and cross-referencing can be good. However, the safest way to understand context and meaning is to read whole Bible books. Chapter and verse numbers were added for convenience in the 16th century, but unfortunately they can cause the Bible to seem like an encyclopedia. The Aionian Bible is formatted with simple verse numbering, minimal notes, and no cross-referencing in order to encourage the reading of Bible books.</p>

<p>Bible reading must also begin with prayer. Any Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible with God’s help. However, this freedom is also a responsibility because without the Holy Spirit we cannot interpret accurately. We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-2'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-2');	return false;">1 Corinthians 2:13-14</a>, <i>"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."</i> So we cannot understand in our natural self, but we can with God’s help through prayer.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the best writer and he uses literary devices such as introductions, conclusions, paragraphs, and metaphors. He also writes various genres including historical narrative, prose, and poetry. So Bible study must spiritually discern and understand literature. Pray, read, observe, interpret, and apply. Finally, <i>"Do your best to present yourself approved by God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth."</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Timothy-2'		onclick="ABDO('2-Timothy-2');		return false;">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <i>"God has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-1'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-1');		return false;">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>.</p>

<p><a href="?Maps" title="Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Bible maps" onclick="ABDO('Maps');return false;">Middle Eastern and Mediterranean maps</a> and 

<a href="?Past" title="Bible timelines and Church history charts" onclick="ABDO('Past');return false;">Bible timelines and Church history charts</a> are also available to help your study.</p>

<p>The <i>Aionian Bible</i> un-translates and instead transliterates eleven special words to help us better understand the extent of God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.  The original translation is unaltered and a note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses. Compare the definitions below to the <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Concordance</a>.

<h3><i><a id="g1653">eleēsē</a></i></h3>
Language: Koine Greek<br>
Speech: verb<br>
Strongs: g1653<br>
Meaning:<br><div style='margin-left: 15px;'>To have pity on, to show mercy. Typically, the subjunctive mood indicates possiblity, not certainty. However, a subjunctive in a purpose clause is a resulting action as certain as the causal action. The subjunctive in a purpose clause functions as an indicative, not an optative. Thus, the grand conclusion of grace theology in Romans 11:32 must be clarified. God's mercy on all is not a possibility, but a certainty.

<p>The Aionian Bible shows the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian Glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;">Aionian Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of after-life destinies. The underlying Hebrew and Greek words typically translated as <i>Hell</i> show us that there are not just two after-life destinies, Heaven or Hell.  Instead, there are a number of different locations, each with different purposes, different durations, and different inhabitants. Locations include 1) Old Testament <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i>Sheol</i></a> and New Testament <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i>Hadēs</i></a>, 2) <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i>Geenna</i></a>, 3) <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i>Tartaroō</i></a>, 4) <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i>Abyssos</i></a>, 5) <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i>Limnē Pyr</i></a>, 6) <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Paradise</a>, 7) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Heaven</a>, and 8) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Earth</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The key observation is that fallen angels will be present at the final judgment, <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a> and  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>. Traditionally, we understand the separation of the Sheep and the Goats at the final judgment to divide believing from unbelieving mankind, <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:31-46</a> and <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. However, the presence of fallen angels alternatively suggests that Jesus is separating redeemed mankind from the fallen angels.  We do know that Jesus is the helper of mankind and not the helper of the Devil, <a title='View Reference' href='?Hebrews-2'			onclick="ABDO('Hebrews-2');		return false;">Hebrews 2</a>. We also know that Jesus has atoned for the sins of all mankind, both believer and unbeliever alike, <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:1-2</a>. Deceased believers are rewarded in Paradise, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Luke 23:43</a>, while unbelievers are punished in Hades as the story of Lazarus makes plain, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-16'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-16');			return false;">Luke 16:19-31</a>. Yet less commonly known, the punishment of this selfish man and all unbelievers is before the final judgment, is temporal, and is punctuated when Hades is evacuated, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>. So is there hope beyond Hades for unbelieving mankind? Jesus promised, <i>“the gates of Hades will not prevail,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-16'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-16');		return false;">Matthew 16:18</a>. Paul asks, <i>“Hades where is your victory?”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-15'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-15');	return false;">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>. John wrote, <i>“Hades gives up,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus comforts us saying, <i>“Do not be afraid,”</i> because he holds the keys to <i>unlock</i> death and Hades, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-1'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-1');		return false;">Revelation 1:18</a>. Yet too often our <i>Good News</i> sounds like a warning to <i>“be afraid”</i> because Jesus holds the keys to <i>lock</i> Hades!  Wow, we have it backwards!  Hades will be evacuated!  And to guarrantee hope, once emptied, Hades is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never needed again, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we read that anyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life is thrown into the Lake of Fire, the second death, with no exit ever mentioned or promised, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">Revelation 21:1-8</a>. So are those evacuated from Hades then, <i>“out of the frying pan, into the fire?”</i>  Certainly, the Lake of Fire is the destiny of the Goats.  But, do not be afraid. Instead, read the Bible's explicit mention of the purpose of the Lake of Fire and the identity of the Goats. <i>“Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the consummate fire which is prepared for... the devil and his angels,’”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>. Bad news for the Devil. Good news for all mankind!</p>

<p>Faith is not a pen to write your own name in the Book of Life. Instead, faith is the glasses to see that the love of Christ for all mankind has already written our names in Heaven. Jesus said, <i>“You did not choose me, but I chose you,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?John-15'			onclick="ABDO('John-15');			return false;">John 15:16</a>.  Though unbelievers will suffer regrettable punishment in Hades, redeemed mankind will never enter the Lake of Fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And as God promised, all mankind will worship Christ together forever, <a title='View Reference' href='?Philippians-2'		onclick="ABDO('Philippians-2');	return false;">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.</p>
