<p>This a Progressive Web App (PWA) format of one <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>. PWAs are special webpages designed to install an App icon and be available offline on a smart device if an Internet connection is not available. Visit <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Read' target='_blank' title='Select from all AionianBible.org translations'>AionianBible.org</a> for all Bibles.</p>

<p>The  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>  is the world’s first Bible <i>un-translation</i>!  What is an  <i>un-translation</i>?  Bibles are translated into each of our languages from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.  Occasionally, the best word translation cannot be found and these words are transliterated letter by letter.  Four well known transliterations are  <i>Christ</i>,  <i>baptism</i>,  <i>angel</i>, and  <i>apostle</i>.  The meaning is then preserved more accurately through context and a dictionary.  The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible un-translates and instead transliterates eleven additional <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>The first three words are  <a href="?Glossary#g165" title="Aionian glossary g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g166" title="Aionian glossary g166" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g166');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g126" title="Aionian glossary g126" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g126');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i></a>,  typically translated as  <i>eternal</i>  and also  <i>world</i>  or  <i>eon</i>. The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible is named after an alternative spelling of  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>. Consider that researchers question if  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  and  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  actually mean <i>eternal</i>. Translating  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  as <i>eternal</i> in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-28'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-28');		return false;">Matthew 28:20</a>  makes no sense, as all agree. The Greek word for eternal is  <i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i>, used in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-1'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-1');			return false;">Romans 1:20</a>  about God and in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>  about demon imprisonment. Yet what about  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>? Certainly we do not question whether salvation is eternal! However,  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  means something much more wonderful than infinite time! Ancient Greeks used  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  to mean eon or age. They also used the adjective  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  to mean entirety, such as  <i>complete</i>  or even <i>consummate</i>, but never infinite time. Read <a href="?Aionian" title="Aiōn and Aiōnios" onclick="ABDO('Aionian');return false;">Dr. Heleen Keizer and Ramelli and Konstan</a> for proofs. So  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  is the perfect description of God's Word which has  <i>everything</i>  we need for life and godliness! And the  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  life promised in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>  is not simply a ticket to eternal life in the future, but the invitation through faith to the  <i>consummate</i>  life beginning now!  <i class='notranslate'>Aiōnios</i>  life with Christ is <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Buy#Better' target='_blank'><i>Better than Forever</i></a>.</p>

<p>The next seven words are  <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041 g4442" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i></a>. These words are often translated as  <i>Hell</i>, the place of eternal punishment. However,  <i>Hell</i>  is ill-defined when compared with the Hebrew and Greek.  For example,  <i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i>  is the abode of deceased believers and unbelievers and should never be translated as  <i>Hell</i>.  <i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i>  is a temporary place of punishment,  <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i>  is the Valley of Hinnom, Jerusalem's refuse dump, a temporal judgment for sin.  <i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i>  is a prison for demons, mentioned once in  <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i>  is a temporary prison for the Beast and Satan. Translators are also inconsistent because  <i>Hell</i>  is used by the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---King-James-Version' target='_blank' title='King James Version'>King James Version</a>  54 times, the  <a href='https://www.thenivbible.com/' target='_blank' title='New International Version Bible'>New International Version</a>  14 times, and the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---World-English-Bible' target='_blank' title='World English Bible'>World English Bible</a>  zero times.  Finally,  <i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i>  is the Lake of Fire, yet  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>  explains that these fires are  <a href="?Destiny" title="Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels" onclick="ABDO('Destiny');return false;">prepared for the Devil and his angels</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The eleventh word,  <a href="?Glossary#g1653" title="Aionian glossary g1653" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1653');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>eleēsē</i></a>, reveals the grand conclusion of grace in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-11'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-11');		return false;">Romans 11:32</a>. Take the time to understand these eleven words.  The original translation is unaltered and a highlighted note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses.  Also to help parallel study and <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Enhanced Concordance</a> use, apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard.

<p>Dr. Heleen Keizer wrote <b><i>Life Time Entirety</i></b> to explain the meaning of the Greek word aiōn. She begins, "<i>The Greek word aiōn has a wide ranging meaning as well as a wide ranging history: it is most commonly translated as ‘eternity’ but has as its first meaning ‘life’ or ‘lifetime’; it has its place in Greek literature and philosophy, but also in the Greek Bible, where it represents the Hebrew word ‘olâm.</i>" Her 315 page PhD dissertation shows that the Greek word aiōn originally denotes life time, duration, or complete life, but not eternal. You can read her <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer' target='_blank' title='Visit Dr. Keizers dissertation online'>dissertation online</a> or an <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer-Abstract' target='_blank' title='View an abstract of Dr. Keizers dissertation'>abstract of her conclusions here</a>.</p>

<p>Ilaria Ramelli and David Konstan wrote <b><i>Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts</i></b>, <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Terms-for-Eternity-Ramelli-Konstan' target='_blank' title='Purchase Ramelli and Konstan at Amazon.com'>available at Amazon</a>. This highly technical volume quotes hundreds of sources from classical literature, the Septuagint, early church fathers, and church fathers after Origen to determine the meaning and usage of <i>Aiōnios</i> and <i>Aïdios</i>.  They conclude that <i>Aïdios</i> nearly always means eternal in the absolute sense.  <i>Aïdios</i> is used twice in the Bible: Romans 1:20 concerning God and Jude 6 concerning the bonds on fallen angels.  <i>Aiōnios</i>, however, has a range of meanings including life, age, generation, and eon.  They argue that <i>Aiōnios</i> can also mean eternal, but only when God is the subject.  Ramelli and Konstan concur with Keizer and conclude saying, "<i>Needless to say, the ethical implications of this question are profound.</i>"</p>

<p>Every quest for the truth must have the wisdom to eliminate what we prefer to be true and also the courage to eliminate what we fear to be true in order to discover what Christ says is actually true.</p>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Philip coming to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And when Simon saw that the holy Spirit was given by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip running up to him,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he said, How can I, unless some one guide me? and he desired Philip to come up and sit with him.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >in his humiliation his judgement was taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth."</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom doth the prophet say this? of himself, or of some other person?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See here is water, what hindereth me from being baptized?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he ordered the chariot to stop: and they both went down to the water, Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span></span>

<p>The Aionian Bible republishes public domain and Creative Common Bible texts that are 100% free to copy and print. The original translation is unaltered and notes are added to help your study. The notes show the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>Who has the authority to interpret the Bible and examine the underlying Hebrew and Greek words? That is a good question! We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:27</a>, <i>"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."</i> Every Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible! Now that does not mean we will all agree. Each of us is still growing in our understanding of the truth. However, it does mean that there is no infallible human or tradition to answer all our questions. Instead the Holy Spirit helps each of us to know the truth and grow closer to God and each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is a library with 66 books in the Protestant Canon. The best way to learn God’s word is to read entire books. Read the book of Genesis. Read the book of <a title='View Reference' href='?John'				onclick="ABDO('John');				return false;">John</a>. Read the entire Bible library. Topical studies and cross-referencing can be good. However, the safest way to understand context and meaning is to read whole Bible books. Chapter and verse numbers were added for convenience in the 16th century, but unfortunately they can cause the Bible to seem like an encyclopedia. The Aionian Bible is formatted with simple verse numbering, minimal notes, and no cross-referencing in order to encourage the reading of Bible books.</p>

<p>Bible reading must also begin with prayer. Any Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible with God’s help. However, this freedom is also a responsibility because without the Holy Spirit we cannot interpret accurately. We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-2'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-2');	return false;">1 Corinthians 2:13-14</a>, <i>"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."</i> So we cannot understand in our natural self, but we can with God’s help through prayer.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the best writer and he uses literary devices such as introductions, conclusions, paragraphs, and metaphors. He also writes various genres including historical narrative, prose, and poetry. So Bible study must spiritually discern and understand literature. Pray, read, observe, interpret, and apply. Finally, <i>"Do your best to present yourself approved by God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth."</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Timothy-2'		onclick="ABDO('2-Timothy-2');		return false;">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <i>"God has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-1'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-1');		return false;">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>.</p>

<p><a href="?Maps" title="Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Bible maps" onclick="ABDO('Maps');return false;">Middle Eastern and Mediterranean maps</a> and 

<a href="?Past" title="Bible timelines and Church history charts" onclick="ABDO('Past');return false;">Bible timelines and Church history charts</a> are also available to help your study.</p>

<p>The <i>Aionian Bible</i> un-translates and instead transliterates eleven special words to help us better understand the extent of God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.  The original translation is unaltered and a note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses. Compare the definitions below to the <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Concordance</a>.

<h3><i><a id="g1653">eleēsē</a></i></h3>
Language: Koine Greek<br>
Speech: verb<br>
Strongs: g1653<br>
Meaning:<br><div style='margin-left: 15px;'>To have pity on, to show mercy. Typically, the subjunctive mood indicates possiblity, not certainty. However, a subjunctive in a purpose clause is a resulting action as certain as the causal action. The subjunctive in a purpose clause functions as an indicative, not an optative. Thus, the grand conclusion of grace theology in Romans 11:32 must be clarified. God's mercy on all is not a possibility, but a certainty.

<p>The Aionian Bible shows the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian Glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;">Aionian Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of after-life destinies. The underlying Hebrew and Greek words typically translated as <i>Hell</i> show us that there are not just two after-life destinies, Heaven or Hell.  Instead, there are a number of different locations, each with different purposes, different durations, and different inhabitants. Locations include 1) Old Testament <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i>Sheol</i></a> and New Testament <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i>Hadēs</i></a>, 2) <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i>Geenna</i></a>, 3) <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i>Tartaroō</i></a>, 4) <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i>Abyssos</i></a>, 5) <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i>Limnē Pyr</i></a>, 6) <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Paradise</a>, 7) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Heaven</a>, and 8) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Earth</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The key observation is that fallen angels will be present at the final judgment, <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a> and  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>.

However, the presence of fallen angels alternatively suggests that Jesus is separating redeemed mankind from the fallen angels.  We do know that Jesus is the helper of mankind and not the helper of the Devil, <a title='View Reference' href='?Hebrews-2'			onclick="ABDO('Hebrews-2');		return false;">Hebrews 2</a>. We also know that Jesus has atoned for the sins of all mankind, both believer and unbeliever alike, <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:1-2</a>. Deceased believers are rewarded in Paradise, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Luke 23:43</a>, while unbelievers are punished in Hades as the story of Lazarus makes plain, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-16'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-16');			return false;">Luke 16:19-31</a>. Yet less commonly known, the punishment of this selfish man and all unbelievers is before the final judgment, is temporal, and is punctuated when Hades is evacuated, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>. So is there hope beyond Hades for unbelieving mankind? Jesus promised, <i>“the gates of Hades will not prevail,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-16'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-16');		return false;">Matthew 16:18</a>. Paul asks, <i>“Hades where is your victory?”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-15'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-15');	return false;">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>. John wrote, <i>“Hades gives up,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus comforts us saying, <i>“Do not be afraid,”</i> because he holds the keys to <i>unlock</i> death and Hades, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-1'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-1');		return false;">Revelation 1:18</a>. Yet too often our <i>Good News</i> sounds like a warning to <i>“be afraid”</i> because Jesus holds the keys to <i>lock</i> Hades!  Wow, we have it backwards!  Hades will be evacuated!  And to guarrantee hope, once emptied, Hades is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never needed again, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we read that anyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life is thrown into the Lake of Fire, the second death, with no exit ever mentioned or promised, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">Revelation 21:1-8</a>. So are those evacuated from Hades then, <i>“out of the frying pan, into the fire?”</i>  Certainly, the Lake of Fire is the destiny of the Goats.  But, do not be afraid. Instead, read the Bible's explicit mention of the purpose of the Lake of Fire and the identity of the Goats. <i>“Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the consummate fire which is prepared for... the devil and his angels,’”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>. Bad news for the Devil. Good news for all mankind!</p>

<p>Faith is not a pen to write your own name in the Book of Life. Instead, faith is the glasses to see that the love of Christ for all mankind has already written our names in Heaven. Jesus said, <i>“You did not choose me, but I chose you,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?John-15'			onclick="ABDO('John-15');			return false;">John 15:16</a>.  Though unbelievers will suffer regrettable punishment in Hades, redeemed mankind will never enter the Lake of Fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And as God promised, all mankind will worship Christ together forever, <a title='View Reference' href='?Philippians-2'		onclick="ABDO('Philippians-2');	return false;">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.</p>
