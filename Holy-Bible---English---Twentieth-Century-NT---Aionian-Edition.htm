<p>This a Progressive Web App (PWA) format of one <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>. PWAs are special webpages designed to install an App icon and be available offline on a smart device if an Internet connection is not available. Visit <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Read' target='_blank' title='Select from all AionianBible.org translations'>AionianBible.org</a> for all Bibles.</p>

<p>The  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>  is the world’s first Bible <i>un-translation</i>!  What is an  <i>un-translation</i>?  Bibles are translated into each of our languages from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.  Occasionally, the best word translation cannot be found and these words are transliterated letter by letter.  Four well known transliterations are  <i>Christ</i>,  <i>baptism</i>,  <i>angel</i>, and  <i>apostle</i>.  The meaning is then preserved more accurately through context and a dictionary.  The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible un-translates and instead transliterates eleven additional <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>The first three words are  <a href="?Glossary#g165" title="Aionian glossary g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g166" title="Aionian glossary g166" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g166');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g126" title="Aionian glossary g126" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g126');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i></a>,  typically translated as  <i>eternal</i>  and also  <i>world</i>  or  <i>eon</i>. The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible is named after an alternative spelling of  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>. Consider that researchers question if  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  and  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  actually mean <i>eternal</i>. Translating  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  as <i>eternal</i> in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-28'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-28');		return false;">Matthew 28:20</a>  makes no sense, as all agree. The Greek word for eternal is  <i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i>, used in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-1'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-1');			return false;">Romans 1:20</a>  about God and in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>  about demon imprisonment. Yet what about  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>? Certainly we do not question whether salvation is eternal! However,  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  means something much more wonderful than infinite time! Ancient Greeks used  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  to mean eon or age. They also used the adjective  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  to mean entirety, such as  <i>complete</i>  or even <i>consummate</i>, but never infinite time. Read <a href="?Aionian" title="Aiōn and Aiōnios" onclick="ABDO('Aionian');return false;">Dr. Heleen Keizer and Ramelli and Konstan</a> for proofs. So  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  is the perfect description of God's Word which has  <i>everything</i>  we need for life and godliness! And the  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  life promised in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>  is not simply a ticket to eternal life in the future, but the invitation through faith to the  <i>consummate</i>  life beginning now!  <i class='notranslate'>Aiōnios</i>  life with Christ is <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Buy#Better' target='_blank'><i>Better than Forever</i></a>.</p>

<p>The next seven words are  <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041 g4442" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i></a>. These words are often translated as  <i>Hell</i>, the place of eternal punishment. However,  <i>Hell</i>  is ill-defined when compared with the Hebrew and Greek.  For example,  <i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i>  is the abode of deceased believers and unbelievers and should never be translated as  <i>Hell</i>.  <i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i>  is a temporary place of punishment,  <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i>  is the Valley of Hinnom, Jerusalem's refuse dump, a temporal judgment for sin.  <i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i>  is a prison for demons, mentioned once in  <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i>  is a temporary prison for the Beast and Satan. Translators are also inconsistent because  <i>Hell</i>  is used by the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---King-James-Version' target='_blank' title='King James Version'>King James Version</a>  54 times, the  <a href='https://www.thenivbible.com/' target='_blank' title='New International Version Bible'>New International Version</a>  14 times, and the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---World-English-Bible' target='_blank' title='World English Bible'>World English Bible</a>  zero times.  Finally,  <i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i>  is the Lake of Fire, yet  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>  explains that these fires are  <a href="?Destiny" title="Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels" onclick="ABDO('Destiny');return false;">prepared for the Devil and his angels</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The eleventh word,  <a href="?Glossary#g1653" title="Aionian glossary g1653" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1653');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>eleēsē</i></a>, reveals the grand conclusion of grace in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-11'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-11');		return false;">Romans 11:32</a>. Take the time to understand these eleven words.  The original translation is unaltered and a highlighted note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses.  Also to help parallel study and <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Enhanced Concordance</a> use, apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard.

<p>Dr. Heleen Keizer wrote <b><i>Life Time Entirety</i></b> to explain the meaning of the Greek word aiōn. She begins, "<i>The Greek word aiōn has a wide ranging meaning as well as a wide ranging history: it is most commonly translated as ‘eternity’ but has as its first meaning ‘life’ or ‘lifetime’; it has its place in Greek literature and philosophy, but also in the Greek Bible, where it represents the Hebrew word ‘olâm.</i>" Her 315 page PhD dissertation shows that the Greek word aiōn originally denotes life time, duration, or complete life, but not eternal. You can read her <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer' target='_blank' title='Visit Dr. Keizers dissertation online'>dissertation online</a> or an <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer-Abstract' target='_blank' title='View an abstract of Dr. Keizers dissertation'>abstract of her conclusions here</a>.</p>

<p>Ilaria Ramelli and David Konstan wrote <b><i>Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts</i></b>, <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Terms-for-Eternity-Ramelli-Konstan' target='_blank' title='Purchase Ramelli and Konstan at Amazon.com'>available at Amazon</a>. This highly technical volume quotes hundreds of sources from classical literature, the Septuagint, early church fathers, and church fathers after Origen to determine the meaning and usage of <i>Aiōnios</i> and <i>Aïdios</i>.  They conclude that <i>Aïdios</i> nearly always means eternal in the absolute sense.  <i>Aïdios</i> is used twice in the Bible: Romans 1:20 concerning God and Jude 6 concerning the bonds on fallen angels.  <i>Aiōnios</i>, however, has a range of meanings including life, age, generation, and eon.  They argue that <i>Aiōnios</i> can also mean eternal, but only when God is the subject.  Ramelli and Konstan concur with Keizer and conclude saying, "<i>Needless to say, the ethical implications of this question are profound.</i>"</p>

<p>Every quest for the truth must have the wisdom to eliminate what we prefer to be true and also the courage to eliminate what we fear to be true in order to discover what Christ says is actually true.</p>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Afterwards Jesus called his disciples to him, and said: “My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry, for fear that they should break down on the way.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Where can we,” his disciples asked, “in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the Chief Priests and the Councillors of the Nation met in the house of the High Priest, who was called Caiaphas,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they said: “Not during the Festival, for fear of causing a riot.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of Simon the leper,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume upon his head as he was at table.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The disciples were indignant at seeing this. “What is this waste for?” they exclaimed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Why are you troubling the woman?” Jesus said, when he noticed it. “For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, while they were eating, he said: “I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In great grief they began to say to him, one by one: “Can it be I, Master?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words: “Drink from it, all of you;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to them: “Even you will all fall away from me to-night. Scripture says — ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“If every one else falls away from you,” Peter answered, “I shall never fall away!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“I tell you,” replied Jesus, “that this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples: “Sit down here while I go and pray yonder.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebediah, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“I am sad at heart,” he said, “sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer. “My Father,” he said, “if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I will, but as thou willest.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep. “What!” he said to Peter, “could none of you watch with me for one hour?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Watch and pray, that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed. “My Father,” he said, “if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, thy will be done!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he came to the disciples, and said: “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Hark! my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked men.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Up, and let us be going. Look! my betrayer is close at hand.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the Chief Priests and Councillors of the Nation.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed: “Welcome, Rabbi!” and kissed him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >on which Jesus said to him: “Friend, do what you have come for.” Thereupon the men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the High Priest’s servant, cut off his ear.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Sheathe your sword,” Jesus said, “for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus at the same time said to the crowds: “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me?

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The whole of this occurred in fulfilment of the Prophetic Scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>57 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the High Priest, where the Teachers of the Law and the Councillors had assembled.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>58 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the offices, to see the end.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>59 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Meanwhile the Chief Priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>60 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said:</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>62 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the High Priest stood up, and said to Jesus: “Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>63 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus remained silent. On this the High Priest said to him: “I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>64 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“It is true,” Jesus answered; “Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you shall ‘see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.’”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>65 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the High Priest tore his robes. “This is blasphemy!” he exclaimed. “Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>66 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >What is your decision?” They answered: “He deserves death.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>67 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so:</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>68 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Now play the Prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>69 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed: “Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>70 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Peter denied it before them all. “I do not know what you mean,” he replied.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>71 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there: “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>72 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>73 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But soon afterwards those who were standing by came up and said to Peter: “You also are certainly one of them; why, your very way of speaking proves it!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>74 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Peter began to swear, with most solemn imprecations: “I do not know the man.” At that moment a cock crowed;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>75 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said — ‘Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times’; and he went outside, and wept bitterly.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For Jesus had said: “Come out from the man, you foul spirit.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove — about two thousand in number — rushed down the steep slope into the Sea and were drowned in the Sea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On this the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country round; and the people went to see what had happened.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind — the very man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him — and they were awe-struck.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus refused. “Go back to your home, to your own people,” he said, “and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and every one was amazed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >By the time Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the Sea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And one of the Presidents of the Synagogue, whose name was Jaeirus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet with repeated entreaties.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus went with him. A great number of People followed Jesus, and kept pressing round him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse),</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning round in the crowd, he said: “Who touched my clothes?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the Synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this?” they said, “and what is this wisdom that has been given him? and these miracles which he is doing?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Is not he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon?

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >on which Jesus said: “A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country, and among his own relations, and in his own home.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands upon a few infirm persons, and curing them;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went round the villages, one after another, teaching.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his Messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey — not even bread, or a bag, or pence in their purse;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Whenever you go to stay at a house,” he said, “remain there till you leave that place;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Others again said — “He is Elijah,” and others — “He is a Prophet, like one of the great Prophets.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when Herod heard of him, he said — “The man whom I beheaded — John — he must be risen!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For John had said to Herod — “You have no right to be living with your brother’s wife.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Herodias was incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to do so,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and protected him. He had listened to John, but still remained much perplexed, and yet he found pleasure in listening to him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the foremost men in Galilee.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And when his daughter — that is, the daughter of Herodias — came in and danced, she delighted Herod and those who were dining with him. “Ask me for whatever you like,” the King said to the girl, “and I will give it to you”;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked him — up to half his kingdom.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The girl went out, and said to her mother “What must I ask for?” “The head of John the Baptizer,’ answered her mother.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So she went in as quickly as possible to the King, and made her request. “I want you,” she said, “to give me at once, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The King was much distressed; yet, on account of his oath and of the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He immediately dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John’s head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, bringing his head on a dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body away, and laid it in a tomb.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When the Apostles came back to Jesus, they told him all that they had done and all that they had taught.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Come by yourselves privately to some lonely spot,” he said, “and rest for a while” — for there were so many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they set off privately in their boat for a lonely spot.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And many people saw them going, and recognised them, and from all the towns they flocked together to the place on foot, and got there before them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them, because they were ‘like sheep without a shepherd’; and he began to teach them many things.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When it grew late, his disciples came up to him, and said: “This is a lonely spot, and it is already late.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Send the people away, so that they may go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus answered: “It is for you to give them something to eat.” “Are we to go and buy twenty pounds’ worth of bread,” they asked, “to give them to eat?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“How many loaves have you?” he asked; “Go, and see.” When they had found out, they told him: “Five, and two fishes.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus directed them to make all the people take their seats on the green grass, in parties;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and they sat down in groups — in hundreds, and in fifties.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Taking the five loaves and the two fishes, Jesus looked up to Heaven, and said the blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two fishes also among them all.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Every one had sufficient to eat;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and they picked up enough broken pieces to fill twelve baskets, as well as some of the fish.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The men who ate the bread were five thousand in number.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately afterwards Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he himself was dismissing the crowd.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After he had taken leave of the people, he went away up the hill to pray.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When evening fell, the boat was out in the middle of the Sea, and Jesus on the shore alone.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Seeing them labouring at the oars — for the wind was against them — about three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the water, intending to join them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for all of them saw him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them. “Courage!” he said, “it is I; do not be afraid!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for they had not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But they had no sooner left her than the people, recognising Jesus,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >hurried over the whole country-side, and began to carry about upon mats those who were ill, wherever they heard he was.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So wherever he went — to villages, or towns, or farms — they would lay their sick in the market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made well.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the Pharisees and the Teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question — “How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >His answer was: “It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words — ‘This is a people that honour me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon: “Push off into deep water, and throw out your nets for a haul.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“We have been hard at work all night, Sir,” answered Simon, “and have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the nets.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to break.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so full of fish that they were almost sinking.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself down at Jesus’ knees, exclaiming: “Master, leave me, for I am a sinful man!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and so, too, were James and John, Zebediah’s sons, who were Simon’s partners. “Do not be afraid,” Jesus said to Simon; “from to-day you shall catch men.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and followed him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who was covered with leprosy.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so: “I am willing; become clean.” Instantly the leprosy left the man;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and then Jesus impressed upon him that he was not to say a word to any one, “but,” he added, “set out and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing, in the manner directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >However, the story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When he saw their faith, Jesus said: “Friend, your sins have been forgiven you.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >No, when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“I have most earnestly wished,” he said, “to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said:</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he said to them all: “When I sent you out as my Messengers, without either purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?” “No; nothing,” they answered.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Master,” they exclaimed, “look, here are two swords!” “Enough!” said Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Why are you asleep?” he asked them. “Rise and pray, that you may not fall into temptation.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when those who were round Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed: “Master, shall we use our swords?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, turning to the Chief Priests and Officers in charge at the Temple and Councillors, who had come for him, he said: “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of Darkness.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the High Priest. Peter followed at a distance.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the court-yard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. Fixing her eyes on him, she said: “Why, this man was one of his companions!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>57 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Peter denied it. “I do not know him,” he replied.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>58 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >A little while afterwards some one else — a man — saw him and said: “Why, you are one of them!” “No,” Peter said, “I am not.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>62 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and he went outside and wept bitterly.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>66 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >At daybreak the National Council met — both the Chief Priests and the Teachers of the Law — and took Jesus before their High Council.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And they began to accuse him: “This is a man whom we found misleading our people, preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he himself is ‘Christ, a King.’”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Are you the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked him. “It is true,” replied Jesus.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Meanwhile the Chief Priests and the Teachers of the Law stood by and vehemently accused him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe round him, and then sent him back to Pilate.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Why, what harm has this man done?” Pilate said to them for the third time. “I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the Apostles.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“What is this that you are saying to each other as you walk along?” Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus: “Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“What things do you mean?” asked Jesus. “Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered, “who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a Prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and how the Chief Priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterwards crucified him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said; but they did not see Jesus.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to them: “O foolish men, slow to accept all that the Prophets have said!</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them all through the Scriptures the passages that referred to himself.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they got near the village to which they were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they pressed him not to do so. “Stay with us,” they said, “for it is getting towards evening, and the sun in already low.” So Jesus went in to stay with them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After he had taken his place at table with them, he took the bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he disappeared from their sight.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“How our hearts glowed,” the disciples said to each other, “while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the Scriptures to us!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven and their companions all together,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >who told them that the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they also related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognised Jesus at the Breaking of the Bread.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While they were still talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, [and said “Peace be with you.” ]</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but Jesus said to them: “Why are you so startled? And why do doubts arise in your minds?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Look at my hands and my feet, and you will know that it is I. Feel me, and look at me, for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >[After saying this he showed them his hands and his feet.]</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While they were still unable to believe it all for very joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them: “Have you anything here to eat?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They handed him a piece of broiled fish,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and he took it and ate it before their eyes.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“This is what I told you,” he said, “when I was still with you — that everything that had been written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms, must be fulfilled.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the Scriptures, saying to them:</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Scripture says that the Christ should suffer, and that he should rise again from the dead on the third day,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed on his authority to all the nations — beginning at Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >You yourselves are to be witnesses to all this.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And now I am myself about to send upon you that which my Father has promised. But you must remain in the city until you have been invested with power from above.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised his hands and blessed them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As he was in the act of blessing them, he left them [and was carried up into Heaven.]</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They [bowed to the ground before him and] returned to Jerusalem full of joy;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and they were constantly in the Temple Courts, blessing God.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There is in Jerusalem, near the Sheep-gate, a Bath with five colonnades round it. It is called in Hebrew ‘Bethesda.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In these colonnades a large number of afflicted people were lying — blind, lame, and crippled.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >One man who was there had been afflicted for thirty-eight years.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him: “Do you wish to be cured?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“I have no one, Sir,” the afflicted man answered, “to put me into the Bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, some one else steps down before me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Stand up,” said Jesus, “take up your mat, and walk about.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began to walk about.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now it was the Sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who had been cured: “This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“The man who cured me,” he answered, “said to me ‘Take up your mat and walk about.’”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Afterwards Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him: “You are cured now; do not sin again, for fear that something worse may befall you.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And that was why the Jews began to persecute Jesus — because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus replied: “My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This made the Jews all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father — putting himself on an equality with God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus made this further reply: “In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as High Priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation —</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the Jews any more, but left that neighbourhood, and went into the country bordering on the Wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“You would have no power over me at all,” answered Jesus, “if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them — their trade was tent-making.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the Synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the Message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them: “Your blood be on your own heads.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the Synagogue.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Crispus, the President of the Synagogue, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision: “Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God’s Message among the people.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to the Jews: “Jews, if this were a case of misdemeanour or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There were about twelve of them in all.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Paul went to the Synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Some of them, however, hardened their hears and refused to believe, denouncing the Cause before the people.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord’s Message.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who were exorcists, to use the Name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits in them. “I adjure you,” they would say, “by the Jesus, whom Paul preaches.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So that not only is this business of ours likely to fall into discredit, but there is the further danger that the Temple of the great Goddess Artemis will be thought nothing of, and that she herself will be deprived of her splendour — though all Roman Asia and the whole world worship her.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they heard this, the men were greatly enraged, and began shouting — “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a Captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The next day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner, and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the wind was against us;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There the Roman Officer found an Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavourable when we came off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and with difficulty, by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called ‘Fair Havens,’ near which was the town of Lasea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This had taken a considerable time, and sailing was already dangerous, for the Fast was already over; and so Paul gave this warning.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“My friends,” he said, “I see that this voyage will be attended with injury and much damage, not only to the cargo and the ship, but to our own lives also.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The Roman Officer, however, was more influenced by the captain and the owner than by what was said by Paul.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, as the harbour was not a suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favour of continuing the voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there. Phoenix was a Cretan harbour, open to the north-east and south-east.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So, when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of Crete, close in shore.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But shortly afterwards a hurricane came down on us off the land — a north-easter, as it is called.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The ship was caught by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way and let her drive before it.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we only just managed to secure the ship’s boat,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, after hoisting it on board, the men frapped the ship. But, afraid of being driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, on the following day, threw out the ship’s tackle with their own hands.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As neither sun nor stars were visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It was then, when they had gone a long time without food, that Paul came forward, and said: “My friends, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and so incurred this injury and damage.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Yet, even as things are, I urge you not to lose courage, for there will not be a single life lost among you — only the ship.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom I serve, stood by me, and said —</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >‘Have no fear, Paul; you must appear before the Emperor, and God himself has given you the lives of all your fellow-voyagers.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore, courage, my friends! for I believe God, that everything will happen exactly as I have been told.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >We shall, however, have to be driven on some island.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It was now the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting about in the Adriatic Sea, when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near land.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they took soundings, and found twenty fathoms of water. After waiting a little, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, as they were afraid of our being driven upon some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the stern, and longed for daylight.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The sailors wanted to leave the ship, and had lowered the boat, on pretence of running out anchors from the bows,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >when Paul said to the Roman Officer and his men: “Unless the sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon that the soldiers cut the ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In the interval before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat. “It is a fortnight to-day,” he said, “that, owing to your anxiety, you have gone without food, taking nothing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So I urge you to take something to eat; your safety depends upon it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >With these words he took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in pieces, and began to eat;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and the men all felt cheered and had something to eat themselves.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There were about seventy-six of us on board, all told.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, for fear that any of them should swim away and make their escape.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the Roman Officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways every one managed to get safely ashore.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In that neighbourhood there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On our reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the soldier who was in charge of him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he spoke to them as follows: “Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, as the Jews opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor — not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the Hope of Israel that I am here in chains.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“We,” was their reply, “have not had any letter about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow-Jews come and reported or said anything bad about you.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But we shall be glad to hear from you what your views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is spoken against on all sides.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject before them.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So, as they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding only — “True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through the Prophet Isaiah to your ancestors —</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles — conflicts without, anxieties within.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Foolish Galatians! Who has been fascinating you — you before whose very eyes Jesus Christ was depicted upon the cross?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you — Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Did you go through so much to no purpose? — if indeed it really was to no purpose!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers — does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? or as the result of your having listened with faith?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It is just as it was with Abraham — ‘He had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the Sons of Abraham.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the Good News to Abraham in the words — ‘Through thee all the Gentiles shall be blessed.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed upon the faith of Abraham.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >All who rely upon obedience to Law are under a curse, for Scripture says — ‘Cursed is every one who does not abide by all that is written in the Book of the Law, and do it.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read — ‘Through faith the righteous man shall find Life.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are — ‘Those who practice these precepts will find Life through them.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for Scripture says — ‘Cursed is any one who is hanged on a tree.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >To take an illustration, Brothers, from daily life — No one sets aside even an agreement between two men, when once it has been confirmed, nor does he add conditions to it.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to thy offspring,’ showing that one person was meant — and that was Christ.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >My point is this — An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make men conscious of their wrong-doings, and intended to last only till the coming of that ‘offspring’ to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Does that set the Law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing Life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the words of Scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, upon faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the Faith that was destined to be revealed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For you are all Sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and freeman, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance.</span></span>

<p>The Aionian Bible republishes public domain and Creative Common Bible texts that are 100% free to copy and print. The original translation is unaltered and notes are added to help your study. The notes show the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>Who has the authority to interpret the Bible and examine the underlying Hebrew and Greek words? That is a good question! We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:27</a>, <i>"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."</i> Every Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible! Now that does not mean we will all agree. Each of us is still growing in our understanding of the truth. However, it does mean that there is no infallible human or tradition to answer all our questions. Instead the Holy Spirit helps each of us to know the truth and grow closer to God and each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is a library with 66 books in the Protestant Canon. The best way to learn God’s word is to read entire books. Read the book of Genesis. Read the book of <a title='View Reference' href='?John'				onclick="ABDO('John');				return false;">John</a>. Read the entire Bible library. Topical studies and cross-referencing can be good. However, the safest way to understand context and meaning is to read whole Bible books. Chapter and verse numbers were added for convenience in the 16th century, but unfortunately they can cause the Bible to seem like an encyclopedia. The Aionian Bible is formatted with simple verse numbering, minimal notes, and no cross-referencing in order to encourage the reading of Bible books.</p>

<p>Bible reading must also begin with prayer. Any Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible with God’s help. However, this freedom is also a responsibility because without the Holy Spirit we cannot interpret accurately. We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-2'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-2');	return false;">1 Corinthians 2:13-14</a>, <i>"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."</i> So we cannot understand in our natural self, but we can with God’s help through prayer.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the best writer and he uses literary devices such as introductions, conclusions, paragraphs, and metaphors. He also writes various genres including historical narrative, prose, and poetry. So Bible study must spiritually discern and understand literature. Pray, read, observe, interpret, and apply. Finally, <i>"Do your best to present yourself approved by God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth."</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Timothy-2'		onclick="ABDO('2-Timothy-2');		return false;">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <i>"God has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-1'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-1');		return false;">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>.</p>

<p><a href="?Maps" title="Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Bible maps" onclick="ABDO('Maps');return false;">Middle Eastern and Mediterranean maps</a> and 

<a href="?Past" title="Bible timelines and Church history charts" onclick="ABDO('Past');return false;">Bible timelines and Church history charts</a> are also available to help your study.</p>

Compare the definitions below to the <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Concordance</a>.

Language: Koine Greek<br>
Speech: verb<br>
Strongs: g1653<br>
Meaning:<br><div style='margin-left: 15px;'>To have pity on, to show mercy. Typically, the subjunctive mood indicates possiblity, not certainty. However, a subjunctive in a purpose clause is a resulting action as certain as the causal action. The subjunctive in a purpose clause functions as an indicative, not an optative. Thus, the grand conclusion of grace theology in Romans 11:32 must be clarified. God's mercy on all is not a possibility, but a certainty.

<p>The Aionian Bible shows the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian Glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;">Aionian Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of after-life destinies. The underlying Hebrew and Greek words typically translated as <i>Hell</i> show us that there are not just two after-life destinies, Heaven or Hell.  Instead, there are a number of different locations, each with different purposes, different durations, and different inhabitants. Locations include 1) Old Testament <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i>Sheol</i></a> and New Testament <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i>Hadēs</i></a>, 2) <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i>Geenna</i></a>, 3) <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i>Tartaroō</i></a>, 4) <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i>Abyssos</i></a>, 5) <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i>Limnē Pyr</i></a>, 6) <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Paradise</a>, 7) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Heaven</a>, and 8) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Earth</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The key observation is that fallen angels will be present at the final judgment, <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a> and  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>. Traditionally, we understand the separation of the Sheep and the Goats at the final judgment to divide believing from unbelieving mankind, <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:31-46</a> and <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. However, the presence of fallen angels alternatively suggests that Jesus is separating redeemed mankind from the fallen angels.  We do know that Jesus is the helper of mankind and not the helper of the Devil, <a title='View Reference' href='?Hebrews-2'			onclick="ABDO('Hebrews-2');		return false;">Hebrews 2</a>. We also know that Jesus has atoned for the sins of all mankind, both believer and unbeliever alike, <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:1-2</a>. Deceased believers are rewarded in Paradise, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Luke 23:43</a>, while unbelievers are punished in Hades as the story of Lazarus makes plain, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-16'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-16');			return false;">Luke 16:19-31</a>. Yet less commonly known, the punishment of this selfish man and all unbelievers is before the final judgment, is temporal, and is punctuated when Hades is evacuated, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>. So is there hope beyond Hades for unbelieving mankind? Jesus promised, <i>“the gates of Hades will not prevail,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-16'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-16');		return false;">Matthew 16:18</a>. Paul asks, <i>“Hades where is your victory?”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-15'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-15');	return false;">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>. John wrote, <i>“Hades gives up,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus comforts us saying, <i>“Do not be afraid,”</i> because he holds the keys to <i>unlock</i> death and Hades, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-1'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-1');		return false;">Revelation 1:18</a>. Yet too often our <i>Good News</i> sounds like a warning to <i>“be afraid”</i> because Jesus holds the keys to <i>lock</i> Hades!  Wow, we have it backwards!  Hades will be evacuated!  And to guarrantee hope, once emptied, Hades is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never needed again, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we read that anyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life is thrown into the Lake of Fire, the second death, with no exit ever mentioned or promised, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">Revelation 21:1-8</a>. So are those evacuated from Hades then, <i>“out of the frying pan, into the fire?”</i>  Certainly, the Lake of Fire is the destiny of the Goats.  But, do not be afraid. Instead, read the Bible's explicit mention of the purpose of the Lake of Fire and the identity of the Goats. <i>“Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the consummate fire which is prepared for... the devil and his angels,’”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>. Bad news for the Devil. Good news for all mankind!</p>

<p>Faith is not a pen to write your own name in the Book of Life. Instead, faith is the glasses to see that the love of Christ for all mankind has already written our names in Heaven. Jesus said, <i>“You did not choose me, but I chose you,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?John-15'			onclick="ABDO('John-15');			return false;">John 15:16</a>.  Though unbelievers will suffer regrettable punishment in Hades, redeemed mankind will never enter the Lake of Fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And as God promised, all mankind will worship Christ together forever, <a title='View Reference' href='?Philippians-2'		onclick="ABDO('Philippians-2');	return false;">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.</p>
