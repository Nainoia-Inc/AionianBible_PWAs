<!-- The Aionian Bible project also serves all its translations as Progressive Web Apps. -->
<!-- Each Bible translation is contained in a single HTM file using javascript to paginate. -->
<!-- The PWA listing, manifests, service workers, and icons are served dynamically. -->
<!-- Dynamic files could be pre-generated, but dynamic results in a simpler GitHub package. -->
<!-- .htaccess rules masquerade each PWA into its own folder allowing multiple-installs. -->

<p>This a Progressive Web App (PWA) format of one <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>. PWAs are special webpages designed to install an App icon and be available offline on a smart device if an Internet connection is not available. Visit <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Read' target='_blank' title='Select from all AionianBible.org translations'>AionianBible.org</a> for all Bibles.</p>

<p>The  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>  is the world’s first Bible <i>un-translation</i>!  What is an  <i>un-translation</i>?  Bibles are translated into each of our languages from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.  Occasionally, the best word translation cannot be found and these words are transliterated letter by letter.  Four well known transliterations are  <i>Christ</i>,  <i>baptism</i>,  <i>angel</i>, and  <i>apostle</i>.  The meaning is then preserved more accurately through context and a dictionary.  The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible un-translates and instead transliterates eleven additional <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>The first three words are  <a href="?Glossary#g165" title="Aionian glossary g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g166" title="Aionian glossary g166" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g166');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g126" title="Aionian glossary g126" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g126');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i></a>,  typically translated as  <i>eternal</i>  and also  <i>world</i>  or  <i>eon</i>. The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible is named after an alternative spelling of  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>. Consider that researchers question if  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  and  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  actually mean <i>eternal</i>. Translating  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  as <i>eternal</i> in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-28'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-28');		return false;">Matthew 28:20</a>  makes no sense, as all agree. The Greek word for eternal is  <i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i>, used in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-1'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-1');			return false;">Romans 1:20</a>  about God and in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>  about demon imprisonment. Yet what about  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>? Certainly we do not question whether salvation is eternal! However,  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  means something much more wonderful than infinite time! Ancient Greeks used  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  to mean eon or age. They also used the adjective  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  to mean entirety, such as  <i>complete</i>  or even <i>consummate</i>, but never infinite time. Read <a href="?Aionian" title="Aiōn and Aiōnios" onclick="ABDO('Aionian');return false;">Dr. Heleen Keizer and Ramelli and Konstan</a> for proofs. So  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  is the perfect description of God's Word which has  <i>everything</i>  we need for life and godliness! And the  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  life promised in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>  is not simply a ticket to eternal life in the future, but the invitation through faith to the  <i>consummate</i>  life beginning now!  <i class='notranslate'>Aiōnios</i>  life with Christ is <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Buy#Better' target='_blank'><i>Better than Forever</i></a>.</p>

<p>The next seven words are  <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041 g4442" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i></a>. These words are often translated as  <i>Hell</i>, the place of eternal punishment. However,  <i>Hell</i>  is ill-defined when compared with the Hebrew and Greek.  For example,  <i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i>  is the abode of deceased believers and unbelievers and should never be translated as  <i>Hell</i>.  <i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i>  is a temporary place of punishment,  <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i>  is the Valley of Hinnom, Jerusalem's refuse dump, a temporal judgment for sin.  <i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i>  is a prison for demons, mentioned once in  <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i>  is a temporary prison for the Beast and Satan. Translators are also inconsistent because  <i>Hell</i>  is used by the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---King-James-Version' target='_blank' title='King James Version'>King James Version</a>  54 times, the  <a href='https://www.thenivbible.com/' target='_blank' title='New International Version Bible'>New International Version</a>  14 times, and the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---World-English-Bible' target='_blank' title='World English Bible'>World English Bible</a>  zero times.  Finally,  <i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i>  is the Lake of Fire, yet  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>  explains that these fires are  <a href="?Destiny" title="Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels" onclick="ABDO('Destiny');return false;">prepared for the Devil and his angels</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The eleventh word,  <a href="?Glossary#g1653" title="Aionian glossary g1653" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1653');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>eleēsē</i></a>, reveals the grand conclusion of grace in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-11'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-11');		return false;">Romans 11:32</a>. Please understand these eleven words.  The original translation is unaltered and a highlighted note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses.  Also to help parallel study and <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Enhanced Concordance</a> use, apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard.

<p>Dr. Heleen Keizer wrote <b><i>Life Time Entirety</i></b> to explain the meaning of the Greek word aiōn. She begins, "<i>The Greek word aiōn has a wide ranging meaning as well as a wide ranging history: it is most commonly translated as ‘eternity’ but has as its first meaning ‘life’ or ‘lifetime’; it has its place in Greek literature and philosophy, but also in the Greek Bible, where it represents the Hebrew word ‘olâm.</i>" Her 315 page PhD dissertation shows that the Greek word aiōn originally denotes life time, duration, or complete life, but not eternal. You can read her <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer' target='_blank' title='Visit Dr. Keizers dissertation online'>dissertation online</a> or an <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer-Abstract' target='_blank' title='View an abstract of Dr. Keizers dissertation'>abstract of her conclusions here</a>.</p>

<p>Ilaria Ramelli and David Konstan wrote <b><i>Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts</i></b>, <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Terms-for-Eternity-Ramelli-Konstan' target='_blank' title='Purchase Ramelli and Konstan at Amazon.com'>available at Amazon</a>. This highly technical volume quotes hundreds of sources from classical literature, the Septuagint, early church fathers, and church fathers after Origen to determine the meaning and usage of <i>Aiōnios</i> and <i>Aïdios</i>.  They conclude that <i>Aïdios</i> nearly always means eternal in the absolute sense.  <i>Aïdios</i> is used twice in the Bible: Romans 1:20 concerning God and Jude 6 concerning the bonds on fallen angels.  <i>Aiōnios</i>, however, has a range of meanings including life, age, generation, and eon.  They argue that <i>Aiōnios</i> can also mean eternal, but only when God is the subject.  Ramelli and Konstan concur with Keizer and conclude saying, "<i>Needless to say, the ethical implications of this question are profound.</i>"</p>

<p>Every quest for the truth must have the wisdom to eliminate what we prefer to be true and also the courage to eliminate what we fear to be true in order to discover what Christ says is actually true.</p>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the Lord had remembered his people and given them food.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the Lord be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The Lord grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.” Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The whole of this occurred in fulfillment of the prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>62 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>64 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“It is true,” Jesus answered, “Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>65 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the high priest tore his robes. “This is blasphemy!” he exclaimed. “Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy!</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>67 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went around the villages, one after another, teaching.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey – not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Whenever you go to stay at a house,” he said, “remain there until you leave that place;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when Herod heard of him, he said – “The man whom I beheaded – John – he must be risen!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For John had said to Herod – “You have no right to be living with your brother’s wife.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Herodias was incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to do so,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and protected him.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the foremost men in Galilee.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The king was much distressed; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He immediately dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John’s head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, bringing his head on a dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body away, and laid it in a tomb.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Come by yourselves privately to some lonely spot,” he said, “and rest for a while” – for there were so many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When it grew late, his disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and it is already late.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“How many loaves have you?” he asked, “Go, and see.” When they had found out, they told him, “Five, and two fish.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and they sat down in groups – in hundreds, and in fifties.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven, and said the blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two fish also among them all.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately afterward Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he himself was dismissing the crowd.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After he had taken leave of the people, he went away up the hill to pray.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When evening fell, the boat was out in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was on the shore alone.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Seeing them laboring at the oars – for the wind was against them – about three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the water, intending to join them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for all of them saw him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them. “Courage!” he said, “it is I; do not be afraid!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for they had not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >hurried over the whole countryside, and began to carry about on mats those who were ill, wherever they heard he was.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So wherever he went – to villages, or towns, or farms – they would lay their sick in the market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made well.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples “Sit down here while I pray.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He took with him Peter, James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep distress of mind.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >A third time he came, and said to them, “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, elders, and the teachers of the Law assembled.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>57 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him –</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>60 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the high priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. “Have you no answer to make?” he asked. “What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>65 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, “Now play the prophet!” and even the guards received him with blows.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>66 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While Peter was in the courtyard down below, one of the high priest’s maidservants came up;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. “It is true,” replied Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the Law, said to one another in mockery,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, at three, Jesus called out loudly, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani?” which means ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he withdrew about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and began to pray.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Father,” he said, “if it is your pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not my will but yours be done.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Why are you asleep?” he asked them. “Rise and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >at which Jesus said to him, “Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when those who were around Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed, “Master, should we use our swords?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >at which Jesus said, “Let me at least do this”; and, touching his ear, he healed the wound.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and the elders, who had come for him, he said, “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of darkness.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said, “Why, this man was one of his companions!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>66 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >At daybreak the assembly of the elders of the people met – both the chief priests and the teachers of the Law – and took Jesus before their High Council.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the Law stood by and vehemently accused him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe around him, and then sent him back to Pilate.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said to them, “You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of which you accuse him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But they began to shout as one man, “Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas for us.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they kept calling out, “Crucify, crucify him!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Why, what harm has this man done?” Pilate said to them for the third time. “I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamor gained the day.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Jesus answered, “I tell you, this very day you will be with me in Paradise.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“There was one thing I did,” replied Jesus, “at which you are all still wondering.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >at which Jesus said, “I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >What does he mean by saying ‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed, “If anyone is thirsty, they should come to me and drink.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >(By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >A religious man and one who reverenced God, with all his household. He was liberal in his charities to the people, and prayed to God constantly.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >One afternoon, about three o’clock, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel from God come to him, and call him by name.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Cornelius fixed his eyes on him and, in great alarm, said, “What is it, Lord?” “Your prayers and your charities,” the angel answered, “have been an acceptable offering to God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And now, send messengers to Joppa and fetch a man called Simon, who is also known as Peter.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He is lodging with a tanner named Simon, who has a house near the sea.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When the angel, who had spoken to him, had gone, Cornelius called two servants and a religious soldier, who was one of his constant attendants,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and, after telling them the whole story, sent them to Joppa.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about midday to pray.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and saw that the heavens were open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by its four corners towards the earth.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he was aware of a voice which said – “Stand up, Peter, kill something, and eat.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“No, Lord, I cannot,” answered Peter, “for I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Again he was aware of a voice which said – “What God has pronounced clean, do not regard as defiled.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This happened three times, and then suddenly it was all taken up into the heavens.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to Simon’s house, came up to the gate,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and called out and asked if the Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter was still pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, “There are two men looking for you at this moment.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Go down at once and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the person you are looking for. What is your reason for coming?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The men replied, “Our centurion, Cornelius, a pious man who reverences God and is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to listen to what you have to say.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Peter invited them in and entertained them. The next day he lost no time in setting out with them, accompanied by some of the Lord’s followers from Joppa;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and the day following he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them, and had invited his relatives and intimate friends to meet them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So, when Peter entered the city, Cornelius met him, and, throwing himself at Peter’s feet, bowed to the ground.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter, however, lifted him up, saying as he did so, “Stand up, I am only human like yourself.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he found a large gathering of people, to whom he said,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“You are doubtless aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to call anyone defiled or unclean.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >That was why I came, when I was sent for, without raising any objection. And now I ask your reason for sending for me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Just three days ago this very hour,” Cornelius said, “I was in my house, saying the Afternoon Prayers, when a man in dazzling clothing suddenly stood before me.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >‘Cornelius,’ he said, ‘your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been accepted, by God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore send to Joppa, and invite the Simon, who is also known as Peter, to come here. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Accordingly I sent to you at once, and you have been so good as to come. And now we are all here in the presence of God, to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Peter began. “I see, beyond all doubt,” he said, “that God does not show partiality,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but that in every nation he who reverences him and does what is right is acceptable to him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >God has sent his message to the Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the good news of peace – and Jesus is Lord of all!</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >the story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This Jesus God raised on the third day, and enabled him to appear,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Further, God charged us to proclaim to the people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by God judge of the living and the dead.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Before Peter had finished saying these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Those converts from Judaism, who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed even on the Gentiles;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for they heard them speaking in different languages and extolling God. At this Peter asked,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ; after which they asked him to stay there a few days longer.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were converts from Judaism began to attack him,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This happened three times, and then all was drawn up again into the heavens.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions –</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the followers, and returned to those who had sent them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they met here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Paul, however, appealed to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty, so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to the Emperor.”</span></span>

<p>The Aionian Bible republishes public domain and Creative Common Bible texts that are 100% free to copy and print. The original translation is unaltered and notes are added to help your study. The notes show the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>Who has the authority to interpret the Bible and examine the underlying Hebrew and Greek words? That is a good question! We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:27</a>, <i>"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."</i> Every Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible! Now that does not mean we will all agree. Each of us is still growing in our understanding of the truth. However, it does mean that there is no infallible human or tradition to answer all our questions. Instead the Holy Spirit helps each of us to know the truth and grow closer to God and each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is a library with 66 books in the Protestant Canon. The best way to learn God’s word is to read entire books. Read the book of Genesis. Read the book of <a title='View Reference' href='?John'				onclick="ABDO('John');				return false;">John</a>. Read the entire Bible library. Topical studies and cross-referencing can be good. However, the safest way to understand context and meaning is to read whole Bible books. Chapter and verse numbers were added for convenience in the 16th century, but unfortunately they can cause the Bible to seem like an encyclopedia. The Aionian Bible is formatted with simple verse numbering, minimal notes, and no cross-referencing in order to encourage the reading of Bible books.</p>

<p>Bible reading must also begin with prayer. Any Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible with God’s help. However, this freedom is also a responsibility because without the Holy Spirit we cannot interpret accurately. We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-2'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-2');	return false;">1 Corinthians 2:13-14</a>, <i>"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."</i> So we cannot understand in our natural self, but we can with God’s help through prayer.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the best writer and he uses literary devices such as introductions, conclusions, paragraphs, and metaphors. He also writes various genres including historical narrative, prose, and poetry. So Bible study must spiritually discern and understand literature. Pray, read, observe, interpret, and apply. Finally, <i>"Do your best to present yourself approved by God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth."</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Timothy-2'		onclick="ABDO('2-Timothy-2');		return false;">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <i>"God has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-1'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-1');		return false;">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>.</p>

<p><a href="?Maps" title="Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Bible maps" onclick="ABDO('Maps');return false;">Middle Eastern and Mediterranean maps</a> and 

<a href="?Past" title="Bible timelines and Church history charts" onclick="ABDO('Past');return false;">Bible timelines and Church history charts</a> are also available to help your study.</p>

<h3><i><a id="g1653">eleēsē</a></i></h3>
Language: Koine Greek<br>
Speech: verb<br>
Strongs: g1653<br>
Meaning:<br><div style='margin-left: 15px;'>To have pity on, to show mercy. Typically, the subjunctive mood indicates possiblity, not certainty. However, a subjunctive in a purpose clause is a resulting action as certain as the causal action. The subjunctive in a purpose clause functions as an indicative, not an optative. Thus, the grand conclusion of grace theology in Romans 11:32 must be clarified. God's mercy on all is not a possibility, but a certainty. See <a href='https://www.ntgreek.org' target='_blank'>www.ntgreek.org</a>.</div>

<p>The Aionian Bible shows the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian Glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;">Aionian Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of after-life destinies. The underlying Hebrew and Greek words typically translated as <i>Hell</i> show us that there are not just two after-life destinies, Heaven or Hell.  Instead, there are a number of different locations, each with different purposes, different durations, and different inhabitants. Locations include 1) Old Testament <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i>Sheol</i></a> and New Testament <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i>Hadēs</i></a>, 2) <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i>Geenna</i></a>, 3) <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i>Tartaroō</i></a>, 4) <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i>Abyssos</i></a>, 5) <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i>Limnē Pyr</i></a>, 6) <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Paradise</a>, 7) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Heaven</a>, and 8) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Earth</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The key observation is that fallen angels will be present at the final judgment, <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a> and  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>. Traditionally, we understand the separation of the Sheep and the Goats at the final judgment to divide believing from unbelieving mankind, <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:31-46</a> and <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. However, the presence of fallen angels alternatively suggests that Jesus is separating redeemed mankind from the fallen angels.  We do know that Jesus is the helper of mankind and not the helper of the Devil, <a title='View Reference' href='?Hebrews-2'			onclick="ABDO('Hebrews-2');		return false;">Hebrews 2</a>. We also know that Jesus has atoned for the sins of all mankind, both believer and unbeliever alike, <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:1-2</a>. Deceased believers are rewarded in Paradise, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Luke 23:43</a>, while unbelievers are punished in Hades as the story of Lazarus makes plain, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-16'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-16');			return false;">Luke 16:19-31</a>. Yet less commonly known, the punishment of this selfish man and all unbelievers is before the final judgment, is temporal, and is punctuated when Hades is evacuated, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>. So is there hope beyond Hades for unbelieving mankind? Jesus promised, <i>“the gates of Hades will not prevail,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-16'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-16');		return false;">Matthew 16:18</a>. Paul asks, <i>“Hades where is your victory?”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-15'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-15');	return false;">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>. John wrote, <i>“Hades gives up,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus comforts us saying, <i>“Do not be afraid,”</i> because he holds the keys to <i>unlock</i> death and Hades, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-1'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-1');		return false;">Revelation 1:18</a>. Yet too often our <i>Good News</i> sounds like a warning to <i>“be afraid”</i> because Jesus holds the keys to <i>lock</i> Hades!  Wow, we have it backwards!  Hades will be evacuated!  And to guarrantee hope, once emptied, Hades is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never needed again, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we read that anyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life is thrown into the Lake of Fire, the second death, with no exit ever mentioned or promised, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">Revelation 21:1-8</a>. So are those evacuated from Hades then, <i>“out of the frying pan, into the fire?”</i>  Certainly, the Lake of Fire is the destiny of the Goats.  But, do not be afraid. Instead, read the Bible's explicit mention of the purpose of the Lake of Fire and the identity of the Goats. <i>“Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the consummate fire which is prepared for... the devil and his angels,’”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>. Bad news for the Devil. Good news for all mankind!</p>

<p>Faith is not a pen to write your own name in the Book of Life. Instead, faith is the glasses to see that the love of Christ for all mankind has already written our names in Heaven. <i>“If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-11'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-11');		return false;">Romans 11:16</a>.  Though unbelievers will suffer regrettable punishment in Hades, redeemed mankind will never enter the Lake of Fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And as God promised, all mankind will worship Christ together forever, <a title='View Reference' href='?Philippians-2'		onclick="ABDO('Philippians-2');	return false;">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.</p>
