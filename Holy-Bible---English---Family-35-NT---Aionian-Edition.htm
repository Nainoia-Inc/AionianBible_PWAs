<p>This a Progressive Web App (PWA) format of one <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>. PWAs are special webpages designed to install an App icon and be available offline on a smart device if an Internet connection is not available. Visit <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Read' target='_blank' title='Select from all AionianBible.org translations'>AionianBible.org</a> for all Bibles.</p>

<p>The  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>  is the world’s first Bible <i>un-translation</i>!  What is an  <i>un-translation</i>?  Bibles are translated into each of our languages from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.  Occasionally, the best word translation cannot be found and these words are transliterated letter by letter.  Four well known transliterations are  <i>Christ</i>,  <i>baptism</i>,  <i>angel</i>, and  <i>apostle</i>.  The meaning is then preserved more accurately through context and a dictionary.  The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible un-translates and instead transliterates eleven additional <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>The first three words are  <a href="?Glossary#g165" title="Aionian glossary g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g166" title="Aionian glossary g166" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g166');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g126" title="Aionian glossary g126" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g126');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i></a>,  typically translated as  <i>eternal</i>  and also  <i>world</i>  or  <i>eon</i>. The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible is named after an alternative spelling of  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>. Consider that researchers question if  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  and  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  actually mean <i>eternal</i>. Translating  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  as <i>eternal</i> in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-28'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-28');		return false;">Matthew 28:20</a>  makes no sense, as all agree. The Greek word for eternal is  <i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i>, used in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-1'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-1');			return false;">Romans 1:20</a>  about God and in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>  about demon imprisonment. Yet what about  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>? Certainly we do not question whether salvation is eternal! However,  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  means something much more wonderful than infinite time! Ancient Greeks used  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  to mean eon or age. They also used the adjective  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  to mean entirety, such as  <i>complete</i>  or even <i>consummate</i>, but never infinite time. Read <a href="?Aionian" title="Aiōn and Aiōnios" onclick="ABDO('Aionian');return false;">Dr. Heleen Keizer and Ramelli and Konstan</a> for proofs. So  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  is the perfect description of God's Word which has  <i>everything</i>  we need for life and godliness! And the  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  life promised in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>  is not simply a ticket to eternal life in the future, but the invitation through faith to the  <i>consummate</i>  life beginning now!  <i class='notranslate'>Aiōnios</i>  life with Christ is <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Buy#Better' target='_blank'><i>Better than Forever</i></a>.</p>

<p>The next seven words are  <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041 g4442" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i></a>. These words are often translated as  <i>Hell</i>, the place of eternal punishment. However,  <i>Hell</i>  is ill-defined when compared with the Hebrew and Greek.  For example,  <i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i>  is the abode of deceased believers and unbelievers and should never be translated as  <i>Hell</i>.  <i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i>  is a temporary place of punishment,  <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i>  is the Valley of Hinnom, Jerusalem's refuse dump, a temporal judgment for sin.  <i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i>  is a prison for demons, mentioned once in  <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i>  is a temporary prison for the Beast and Satan. Translators are also inconsistent because  <i>Hell</i>  is used by the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---King-James-Version' target='_blank' title='King James Version'>King James Version</a>  54 times, the  <a href='https://www.thenivbible.com/' target='_blank' title='New International Version Bible'>New International Version</a>  14 times, and the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---World-English-Bible' target='_blank' title='World English Bible'>World English Bible</a>  zero times.  Finally,  <i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i>  is the Lake of Fire, yet  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>  explains that these fires are  <a href="?Destiny" title="Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels" onclick="ABDO('Destiny');return false;">prepared for the Devil and his angels</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The eleventh word,  <a href="?Glossary#g1653" title="Aionian glossary g1653" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1653');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>eleēsē</i></a>, reveals the grand conclusion of grace in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-11'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-11');		return false;">Romans 11:32</a>. Take the time to understand these eleven words.  The original translation is unaltered and a highlighted note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses.  Also to help parallel study and <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Enhanced Concordance</a> use, apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard.

<p>Dr. Heleen Keizer wrote <b><i>Life Time Entirety</i></b> to explain the meaning of the Greek word aiōn. She begins, "<i>The Greek word aiōn has a wide ranging meaning as well as a wide ranging history: it is most commonly translated as ‘eternity’ but has as its first meaning ‘life’ or ‘lifetime’; it has its place in Greek literature and philosophy, but also in the Greek Bible, where it represents the Hebrew word ‘olâm.</i>" Her 315 page PhD dissertation shows that the Greek word aiōn originally denotes life time, duration, or complete life, but not eternal. You can read her <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer' target='_blank' title='Visit Dr. Keizers dissertation online'>dissertation online</a> or an <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer-Abstract' target='_blank' title='View an abstract of Dr. Keizers dissertation'>abstract of her conclusions here</a>.</p>

<p>Ilaria Ramelli and David Konstan wrote <b><i>Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts</i></b>, <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Terms-for-Eternity-Ramelli-Konstan' target='_blank' title='Purchase Ramelli and Konstan at Amazon.com'>available at Amazon</a>. This highly technical volume quotes hundreds of sources from classical literature, the Septuagint, early church fathers, and church fathers after Origen to determine the meaning and usage of <i>Aiōnios</i> and <i>Aïdios</i>.  They conclude that <i>Aïdios</i> nearly always means eternal in the absolute sense.  <i>Aïdios</i> is used twice in the Bible: Romans 1:20 concerning God and Jude 6 concerning the bonds on fallen angels.  <i>Aiōnios</i>, however, has a range of meanings including life, age, generation, and eon.  They argue that <i>Aiōnios</i> can also mean eternal, but only when God is the subject.  Ramelli and Konstan concur with Keizer and conclude saying, "<i>Needless to say, the ethical implications of this question are profound.</i>"</p>

<p>Every quest for the truth must have the wisdom to eliminate what we prefer to be true and also the courage to eliminate what we fear to be true in order to discover what Christ says is actually true.</p>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >From then on he kept looking for an opportunity to betray Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus saying to Him, “Where do you want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He said: “Go into the city to ‘you know who’ and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near, I will do the Passover with my disciples at your place.”’”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the disciples did as Jesus directed them and prepared the Passover.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When it was evening He was reclining at the table with the twelve.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And as they were eating He said, “Assuredly I say to you that one of you will betray me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This really upset them and they each began to say to Him, “It isn't me, is it, Lord?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In answer He said: “It is the one who dipped his hand in the bowl with me, he will betray me.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, “It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?” He says to him, “You said it!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as they were eating, after taking the bread and blessing it, Jesus broke it, gave it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And taking the cup and giving thanks He gave it to them saying: “Drink of it, all of you;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And after hymn-singing they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus says to them: “All of you will be caused to stumble because of me this night, for it is written: ‘I will strike the Shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But after I am raised I will go before you to Galilee.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter answered and said to Him, “Even if everyone else is caused to stumble because of you, I will never be caused to stumble.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus said to him, “Assuredly I say to you that this night, before any rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter says to Him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the other disciples said the same.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He says to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along He began to be troubled and distressed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus says to them: “My soul is in anguish, to the point of death. Stay here and watch with me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And going a little farther He fell on His face and prayed saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by; nevertheless not as I wish, but as you do.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and He says to Peter: “So, you (pl.) were not able to watch with me one hour!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Watch and pray, so that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit on its part is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And going away a second time He prayed saying, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass from me unless I drink it, let your will be done.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And coming He finds them sleeping again, because their eyes had been weighed down.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So leaving them He went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He comes to His disciples and says to them: “Sleep some more and take your rest! Actually, the hour is here and the Son of the Man is being betrayed into sinners' hands.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Get up, let's go; see, the one who is betraying me has come!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And while He was still speaking, there was Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >(Now His betrayer had given them a sign saying, “Whomever I kiss, it is He; take Him!”)</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he went right up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus said to him, “Friend, what brings you here?” Then approaching they laid hands on Jesus and took Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And then, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest he cut off his ear!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus says to him: “Put your sword back into its place, for all who take the sword will die by the sword.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it has to happen this way?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >At that time Jesus said to the crowd: “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a bandit, to arrest me?

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets should be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples forsook Him and ran away.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>57 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>58 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Peter was following Him at a distance, up to the high priest's courtyard. And going inside he sat down with the attendants, to see the end.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>59 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The chief priests and the elders, in fact the whole Council, kept looking for false witnesses against Jesus so that they could put Him to death,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>60 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but did not find any. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they did not find any. But at last two false witnesses came forward</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>61 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>62 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And standing up the high priest said to Him: “Do you answer nothing? What is it that these men are testifying against you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>63 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus kept silent. So reacting the high priest said to Him, “I put you under oath by the Living God so that you tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>64 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus says to him: “You said it. Furthermore, I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of the Man sitting at the Power's right, and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>65 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the high priest tore his clothes saying: “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? See, now you have heard His blasphemy!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>66 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >What do you think?” So in answer they said, “He deserves death!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>67 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they spat in His face and punched Him, while others slapped Him</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>68 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >saying, “Messiah, prophesy to us! Who is the one who hit you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>69 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a certain servant girl approached him saying, “You too were with Jesus the Galilean.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>70 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But he denied before them all saying, “I don't know what you are saying.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>71 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And having gone out to the gateway, another girl saw him and says to those who were there, “This fellow also was with Jesus the Natsorean.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>72 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he denied again, with an oath, “I do not know the man!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>73 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But a little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Really, you too are one of them, because your very accent gives you away!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>74 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he began to curse and to swear, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>75 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, “Before any rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And going out he cried bitterly.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When early morning came, all the chief priests and elders plotted against Jesus to kill Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And having bound Him they went and handed Him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >(Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, felt regret and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >saying, “I sinned, by betraying innocent blood.” But they said: “What do we care? It's your problem!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So throwing the silver down in the sanctuary he left, and went and hanged himself!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the chief priests took the coins and said, “It isn't lawful to put them into the treasury, being blood money.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So after consultation they bought the potter's field with them, as a burial ground for strangers.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore that field has been called ‘field of blood’ to this day.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, namely: “And they took the thirty silver coins, the value of the one who was priced, whom some of the children of Israel priced,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and they gave them for the potter's field, just as the Lord directed me.”)</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus said to him, “As you say.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But although the chief priests and elders kept accusing Him, He answered nothing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Pilate says to Him, “Don't you hear all that they are saying against you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But He did not answer him, not even one word, so that the governor was really amazed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Just then they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So while they were assembled Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Messiah?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For he knew that they had handed Him over through envy.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because I suffered a great deal in a dream today because of Him.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the chief priests and elders had persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, but destroy Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the governor spoke up and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Pilate says to them, “What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Messiah?” They all say to him, “Let Him be crucified!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the governor said, “But, what evil did He do?” But they kept yelling all the more saying, “Let Him be crucified!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Pilate saw that nothing was being gained but rather a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. It's your problem!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So in answer all the people said, “His blood be upon us and upon our children!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus, after flogging Him, he delivered to be crucified.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They stripped Him and put a scarlet cloak on Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They plaited a crown out of thorns and put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and kneeling before Him they would mock Him saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Spitting on Him they took the reed and hit Him repeatedly on the head.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After they had mocked Him they took the cloak off Him and put His own clothes back on; and they led Him away to be crucified.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as they went out they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon; they compelled him to carry His cross.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon arriving at a place called Golgotha, which means ‘place of a skull’,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >they gave Him sour wine mixed with gall to drink; but having tasted it He would not drink.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Having crucified Him they divided up His clothes by casting lots.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And they put the charge against Him over His head in writing: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they crucified two bandits with Him, one on His right and one on His left.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the passers-by kept blaspheming Him, wagging their heads</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and saying: “You who destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself!” “If you are ‘Son of God’, come down from the cross!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders and Pharisees, said:</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Even the bandits who were crucified with Him were reviling Him in the same way.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour a darkness came over all the land.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying, “Eli, Eli, lima sabachtani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have You abandoned me?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So upon hearing it some of the bystanders said, “This man is calling Elijah.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Right then one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed and started to give Him a drink;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but the rest said: “Don't! Let's see if Elijah comes to save Him.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus called out again with a great shout and dismissed His spirit.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And then, the veil of the temple was ripped in two from top to bottom! And the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that happened they were scared stiff and said, “This Man really was the Son of God!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>57 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now at evening there appeared a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well, the whole Judean countryside and the Jerusalemites started going out to him, and were all being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now John was clothed with camel's hair and with a leather belt around his waist; and he was eating locusts and wild honey.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well it happened in those days that Jesus came from Natsareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, as He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother, of Simon, casting a circular net onto the water, for they were fishermen.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And going on from there a little ways He saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John; they were in their boat mending their nets.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Right away He called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men they followed Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they went into Capernaum. The very next Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And they kept on being amazed at His teaching, because He was teaching them as one having authority, and not like the scribes.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So His fame spread directly into the whole surrounding area of Galilee.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately upon exiting the synagogue they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >That evening, when the sun had set, they started bringing to Him all who were sick and the demonized.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew He was Messiah.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now very early, still night, He got up, slipped out, and went off to a solitary place, where He was praying.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Simon and those with him hunted for Him,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and upon finding Him they said to Him, “Everyone is looking for you.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But He said to them: “Let us go to the neighboring towns, so I can preach there also; that is why I have come.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He was constantly preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and also casting out demons.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And when He said this, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And He sent him away at once, sternly warning him,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >by saying: “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >However he went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news, so that He was no longer able to enter a town openly, but remained outside in deserted places; yet they kept coming to Him from all over.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they watched Him closely, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well, He says to the man with the withered hand, “Come out in the middle!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He said to them: “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After looking around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He says to the man, “Stretch out your hand!” So he stretched, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other!</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they should press in on Him.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Once again He began to teach beside the sea.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He began teaching them many things by parables and said to them in His teaching:</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Some fell on the rocky area where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But upon the sun's rising it was scorched, and because it had no root it was withered up.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and smothered it, and it yielded no fruit.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And some fell into the good ground, and coming up and growing it started to produce fruit—yielding thirty times as much, sixty times as much, even a hundred times as much.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when He was alone, those who were around Him, with the twelve, asked Him about the parable.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He said to them: “To you it has been given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, everything is being given in parables,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He said to them: “Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And these are the ones sown among the thorns: they hear the Word,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex avh' lang='en' >but the worries of this age, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the undue desires for other things come in and smother the Word, and it becomes unfruitful. <span class='not' dir='ltr'><a href='?36' onclick='ABDO(36);return false;' title='View previous annotation'>&lt;</a> aiōn <a href="?Glossary#g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');	return false;"	title='View definition'>g165</a> <a href='?42' onclick='ABDO(42);return false;' title='View next annotation'>&gt;</a></span></span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And these are the ones sown on the good ground: such people hear the Word, welcome it and produce fruit—thirty times as much, sixty times as much, even a hundred times as much.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Also He said to them: “The lamp is not brought to be put under a box or under a bed, is it? Is it not to be placed on its stand?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For there is no ‘hidden’ that may not be exposed, nor has anything been concealed but that it should come to light.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He said to them: “Pay attention to what you hear. With the same measure you use it will be measured to you in return; and to you who hear, more will be added.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He also said: “The Kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter the seed on the ground</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and should sleep and get up night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >All by itself the earth produces fruit: first a shoot, then a head of grain, then full grain in the head.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But as soon as the grain is ready, he sends in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Again He said: “To what shall we compare the Kingdom of God, or with what sort of parable should we illustrate it?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It is like a mustard seed, that when it is sown on the ground is the smallest of all such seeds,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs and produces big branches, so that the birds of the air are able to rest in its shade.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It was with many such parables that He was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But apart from a parable He did not speak to them; privately, however, He would explain everything to His disciples.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Since He was already in the boat, they took off with Him, leaving the crowd behind (other little boats were also with Him).</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well a strong cyclonic wind came up, such that the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling up.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But He was on the poop deck, sleeping on the cushion; so they awakened Him and said to Him, “Teacher, don't you care that we are perishing?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, having been awakened, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Shut up; be muzzled!” So the wind stopped and there was a complete calm.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And He said to them: “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They were terrified and started saying to one another, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Because He was saying to him, “You unclean spirit, come out of the man!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He asked him, “What is your name?” And he answered, saying, “Legion is my name, because we are many.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He started begging Him repeatedly that He would not send them out of that region.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown, among his relatives, even in his own house.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And He marveled at their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He summoned the twelve and began to send them out, two by two, giving them authority over the unclean spirits as He did so.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And He commanded them to take nothing for the road, except just a staff—no knapsack, no bread, no coin in the belt—</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And He said to them: “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from that place.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they went out and started preaching that people should repent,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and they were casting out many demons, and anointing with oil and healing many who were sick.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him; but she couldn't,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a just and holy man. And consulting him he would do many things; indeed, he would hear him with pleasure.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then an opportune day came when on his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his courtiers, the military commanders, and the chief men of Galilee.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded the head to be brought. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >brought the head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon hearing of it, his disciples came, removed the corpse and placed it in a tomb.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and reported all to Him, both what they had done and what they had taught.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Because so many were coming and going that they did not even have leisure to eat, He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest awhile.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they went away in the boat by themselves to a deserted place.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well upon disembarking Jesus saw a large crowd and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and He began to teach them many things.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When it was late in the day, His disciples came to Him and said: “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But in reply He said to them, “You feed them!” They say to Him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and feed them?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He says to them: “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they knew they said, “Five, and two fish.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He directed them all to recline in groups on the green grass.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they reclined in ‘plots’ of hundreds and of fifties.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to His disciples to serve the people; He also divided the two fish among them all.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well they all ate and were filled.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And they picked up twelve full baskets of broken pieces; also of the fish.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And after taking leave of them He went up the mountain to pray.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when evening had passed, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And He saw them straining at rowing, because the wind was against them. Well about the fourth watch of the night He comes to them walking on the water, and would have passed by them;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they saw Him walking on the water, supposed He was a ghost, and yelled!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Because they all saw Him and were terrified. Immediately He spoke with them and said: “Have courage! It is I; don't be afraid!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were totally astounded within themselves, and kept marveling.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Because they had not understood about the loaves—their hearts had been hardened.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After they had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesaret and anchored there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and running about that whole surrounding region they began to carry about on their pallets those who were sick to wherever they heard He was.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Wherever He entered—into villages, towns, or countryside—they would place the sick in the marketplaces, and they would beg Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment; and all who touched Him were healed.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them; this surprised them, and as they followed they started to be afraid.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him and said, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we may ask.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They said to Him, “Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right and one at your left, in your glory.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus said to them: “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They said to Him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them: “You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well when the ten heard it they began to be indignant with James and John.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus summoned them and said to them: “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They came to Jericho. Then as He was going out from Jericho, with His disciples and a large crowd, the blind Bartimaeus (son of Timaeus) was sitting by the roadside begging.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then in answer Jesus said to them: “You do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God—is this not the reason that you err?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And to love Him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength, and to love the neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the Kingdom of God.” And after that no one dared ask Him any question.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, teaching in the temple, Jesus reacted by saying: “How is it that the scribes say that the Messiah is David's son?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Because David himself said by the Holy Spirit: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests, so as to betray Him to them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to them: “All of you will be caused to stumble because of me this night, because it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they came to a place that was named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter: “Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you keep watch for even one hour?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And when He returned He found them sleeping again, because their eyes were being weighed down; and they did not know how to answer Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He came the third time and said to them: “You are still sleeping and resting! It is enough, the hour has come; yes, the Son of the Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Get up, let's be going. See, my betrayer has approached.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So upon arriving he went directly to Him and said to Him, “Rabbi, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they laid their hands on Him and secured Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus reacted by saying to them: “You have come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as if I were a bandit.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I was with you daily in the temple, teaching, and you did not seize me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now a certain young man had followed Him, having a linen cloth thrown around his naked body. The young men grabbed him,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus so as to kill Him, but were not finding any.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>57 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then some stood up and started testifying falsely against Him, saying,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>60 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the high priest stood up in the center and questioned Jesus, saying: “Are you not going to answer? What are these testifying against you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>61 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But He remained silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>62 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus said: “I am, and you will see the Son of the Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of the heaven.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>63 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the high priest tore his clothes and said: “What further need do we have of witnesses?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>64 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >You heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” They all condemned Him to be deserving of death.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>65 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then some began to spit on Him, to cover His face, punch Him and say to Him, “Prophesy!” And the operatives started slapping Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>66 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>67 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him and said, “You too were with Jesus the Natsarene!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>69 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But that servant girl saw him again and began to say to those standing by, “This guy is one of them.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>70 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But again he kept denying it. Again, after a little while, those who were standing by said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them; because you really are a Galilean, and your accent agrees!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>71 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he began to curse and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you are speaking!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>72 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And for the second time a rooster crowed.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus went with them.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well upon hearing these things Jesus marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, “I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Fear took hold of all, and they began glorifying God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited His people!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the whole multitude from the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, because they were overcome by fear. So He got into the boat and returned.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said: “Master, the people are pressing against you and crowding in, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things being done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; but becoming fully awake, they saw His glory, and the two men who stood with Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then it happened: as they were parting from Him, Peter said to Jesus: “Master, it is good for us to be here” and “Should we make three shelters: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah?”—not knowing what he was saying.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But as he was saying this a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they became afraid as they entered the cloud.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And a Voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my beloved Son. Listen to Him!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When the Voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. (They kept quiet and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.)</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now it happened on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that a large crowd met Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And then, a man from the crowd called out, saying: “Teacher, I beg you, look upon my son, for he is my only begotten.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And oh, a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams, and it convulses him with foaming, and it hardly departs from him, destroying him!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then in answer Jesus said: “O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you (pl)? Bring your (sg) son here!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But while he was still coming the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Everyone was amazed at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Let these words sink into your ears, because the Son of the Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But they did not understand this saying; indeed it was concealed from them, in order that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about it.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then an argument started among them as to which of them would be the greatest.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their heart, took a little child and had him stand beside Him,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said to them: “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me receives Him who sent me. Further, he who is least among all of you, he will be great.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then John reacted by saying, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus said to him, “Do not forbid, because he who is not against us is for us.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now it happened, as the days for His Ascension approached, that He set His face to go to Jerusalem,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and He sent messengers ahead of Him. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>53 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But they did not receive Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>54 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well, when His disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and consume them, just like Elijah did?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>55 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But He turned and rebuked them saying: “You do not know of what sort of spirit you are.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>56 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Further, the Son of the Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save.” And they went to another village.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>57 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as they journeyed on the road, it happened that someone said to Him, “Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>58 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus said to him, “The foxes have dens and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of the Man has no place to lay His head.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>59 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>60 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the Kingdom of God.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>61 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And another also said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>62 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to ‘the plow’ and looks back is suitable for the Kingdom of God.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised the rest:</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The Pharisee stood and started praying to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like all the rest—robbers, unjust, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I fast twice a week; I tithe all that I get.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The tax collector, staying a good ways off, did not even venture to look up to heaven, but started beating on his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I say to you that this one went back home justified rather than that one; because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they even started bringing their babies to Him, that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus summoned them and said: “Allow the little children to come to me, and do not hinder them; because the Kingdom of God is of such.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I tell you assuredly, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God the way a little child does will by no means enter it.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and your mother.’”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well upon hearing these things Jesus said to him, “You still lack one thing: sell all you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when he heard this he became very sad, because he was extremely rich.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Jesus saw that he became sad, He said: “How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter the Kingdom of God!</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He took the Twelve aside and said to them: “Take note, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of the Man will be fulfilled:</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Hearing a crowd going by, he asked what it was.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well he shouted, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they reasoned among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went away on a long journey.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of the Man with a kiss?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said to Him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and elders who had come against Him: “Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a bandit?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He questioned Him with many words, but He gave him no answer.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >On their part, the high priests and scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Herod and his soldiers, after ridiculing and mocking Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He released the one who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as they led Him away, they conscripted a certain Simon of Cyrene (coming in from a field), and put the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they arrived at the place called ‘The Skull’, they crucified Him there; also the criminals, one on His right, the other on His left.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing”; while they were dividing up His clothes by casting a lot.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Meanwhile the people stood looking on. And especially the rulers among them were sneering, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if such is the Christ, the chosen of God!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, after giving a loud shout, Jesus said, “Father, it is into your hands that I will commit my spirit.” And having said this, He breathed out His spirit.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So after the two days He departed from there and went on into Galilee.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>46 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus went again to Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine. Now there was a certain royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the Law of Moses won't be broken, are you angry at me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now some of the Jerusalemites were saying: “Isn't this the man they are wanting to kill?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Yet look! He is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to Him. Could it be true that the rulers know that this is really the Christ?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus called out in the temple, teaching and saying: “You do know me, and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own, but the One who sent me is true, whom you do not know.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I do know Him because I am from Him, and He sent me.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they tried to arrest Him, yet no one laid a hand on Him because His hour had not yet come.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now many of the crowd were believing into Him, and they were saying, “Whenever the Christ comes He won't perform more signs than these which this man has done, will He?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, so the Pharisees and the chief priests sent operatives to arrest Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said: “For a little while I am still with you, and then I go to the One who sent me.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the Jews said among themselves: “Where does this fellow intend to go that we won't find him? He doesn't intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does he?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >What word is this that he spoke, ‘You will look for me and not find me’; also, ‘where I am you cannot come’?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now on the last and most important day of the Feast, Jesus stood up and called out saying: “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So upon hearing this word many from the crowd began to say, “This One really is ‘the Prophet’!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So there developed a division in the crowd because of Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Further, some of them were wanting to arrest Him, but no one laid a hand on Him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the operatives came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why haven't you brought him?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>47 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the Pharisees answered them: “You haven't been fooled too, have you?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But this crowd that doesn't know the law is accursed!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>50 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Nicodemus (the one who came to Him at night, being one of them) says to them,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>51 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Our law doesn't judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing, does it?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>52 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They answered and said to him: “You aren't from Galilee too, are you? Search and see that no prophet has ever arisen out of Galilee.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So back into the Praetorium he went and says to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not answer him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Pilate says to Him: “Are you not speaking to me? Don't you know that I have authority to crucify you and authority to release you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus answered: “You would have no authority over me at all if it had not been given to you from Above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >From that moment Pilate really tried to release Him; but the Jews kept shouting, saying: “If you release this fellow you are no friend of Caesar's!

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well, upon hearing this statement Pilate led Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat, in a place called ‘Stone Pavement’, while in Hebrew ‘Gabatha’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So then he handed Him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and lead Him away.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Pilate had also written a notice, and put it on the cross; and the inscription was: JESUS THE NATSOREAN THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; further, it was written in Hebrew, Greek and Latin!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Don't write, ‘The king of the Jews’, but that the fellow said, ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took His clothes and made four parts, a part for each soldier.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they said among themselves, “Let's not rip it, but toss for it, to see whose it will be,” so that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: “They divided my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast a lot.” That is why the soldiers did these things.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Jesus' mother and her sister, Mary of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were standing by His cross.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus, seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He says to His mother, “Woman, there is your son!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then He says to the disciple, “There is your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After this, knowing that everything was now accomplished so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus says, “I'm thirsty!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; so they filled a sponge with sour wine, placed it on a hyssop, and put it to His mouth.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, when He had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “Paid in full!” And bowing His head He dismissed His spirit.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now then, because it was Preparation Day, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews requested Pilate that their legs might be broken and they be removed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one who had been crucified with Him.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And again another Scripture says: “They will look on Him whom they pierced.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After these things Joseph, the one from Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews), requested Pilate that he might remove the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave permission. So he came and removed Jesus' body.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Nicodemus also came (the one who at first came to Jesus by night), bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they took Jesus' body and wrapped it in linen strips, with the aromatic spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now at the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So that is where they put Jesus, because of the Jews' Preparation Day, since the tomb was nearby.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After these things Jesus, risen from the dead, revealed Himself to His disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He did it like this:</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Simon Peter, Thomas (called Twin), Nathanael (from Cana of Galilee), Zebedee's sons and two others of His disciples were together.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Simon Peter says to them, “I'm going fishing.” They say to him, “We're coming with you.” Off they went and got right into the boat, and that whole night they caught nothing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well when daybreak had now come Jesus stood on the beach; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus says to them, “Boys, you don't have any food, do you?” They answered Him, “No.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find.” So they did, and now they were unable to haul it in because of the multitude of fish!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter, “It's the Lord!” Upon hearing that it was the Lord, Simon Peter tied on his outer garment (for he was stripped) and plunged into the sea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the other disciples came in the little boat dragging the net with the fish (for they were not far from the land, but about 100 yards).</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then, as they stepped onto the land they saw a charcoal fire in place with fish lying on it, and bread.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus says to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Simon Peter got up and dragged the net onto the land, full of one hundred and fifty-three large fish; and although being so many, the net was not torn.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus says to them, “Come have breakfast!” Well not one of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are you?”—knowing that it was the Lord.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, as also the fish.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He says to him again, a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?” He says to Him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I'm fond of you.” He says to him, “Shepherd my sheep.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The third time He says to him, “Simon, son of Jonah, are you fond of me?” Peter was grieved in that the third time He said to him, “Are you fond of me?” and said to Him: “Lord, you know all things.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Most assuredly I say to you, when you were younger you used to get dressed and walk where you wished; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands and another will dress you and carry you where you do not wish.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >(He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) And upon saying that He says to him, “Follow me!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But turning around Peter sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following (that is the one who reclined on His chest at the supper and said, “Lord, who is the one who is betraying you?”).</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Seeing him, Peter says to Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So this saying spread among the brothers, that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him [Peter] that he [John] would not die, but, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This is the disciple who is testifying to these things, and who wrote them; and we know that his testimony is true.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Indeed, there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the whole world could contain the books that would be written! Amen.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now a certain man named Simon was in the city first, practicing sorcery and astounding the people of Samaria, affirming himself to be someone great,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >to whom they used to pay attention, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the great power of God.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They listened to him because he had amazed them with his sorceries for a long time.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But, when they believed Philip, as he proclaimed the good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name, Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Even Simon himself believed, and having been baptized he stayed right with Philip; observing miracles and signs occurring, he was amazed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >who upon coming down prayed about them, so that they might receive Holy Spirit,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had only been baptized into the name of Jesus, the Christ.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they laid their hands upon them and they received Holy Spirit.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well, upon observing that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the Apostles' hands, Simon offered them money</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >saying, “Give this power to me also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive Holy Spirit.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Peter said to him: “May your silver go with you into perdition, for thinking that the gift of God could be acquired with money!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >You have neither part nor portion in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Turn away therefore from this your wickedness and make petition to God, in case the intent of your heart may be forgiven you;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for I see you being into a gall of bitterness and a fetter of unrighteousness.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So in answer Simon said, “You make petition to the Lord on my behalf, so that nothing of what you have spoken may come upon me!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So when they had both thoroughly testified and spoken the Word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem; they also evangelized many Samaritan villages.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, “Get up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza; it is desolate.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he got up and went; and there, a man, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court-official of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury, who had come worshiping to Jerusalem</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >—he was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go forward and join this chariot.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So running up Philip heard him reading the prophet Isaiah and said, “Do you really understand what you are reading?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he said, “Well how can I, unless someone guides me?” And he urged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the portion of the Scripture that he was reading was this: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He does not open His mouth.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In His humiliation His justice was removed, and who will recount His generation? Because His life is removed from the earth.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So continuing the eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So opening his mouth and beginning from this Scripture, Philip preached Jesus to him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as they were going down the road they came upon some water, and the eunuch said: “Look, water! What is keeping me from being baptized?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when they came up out of the water, Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any more, because he went on his way rejoicing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Philip was found at Azotus, and as he passed through he evangelized all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So it happened, as he was going, that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” So the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Saul got up from the ground, and upon opening his eyes he saw no one; so leading him by the hand they brought him into Damascus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!” So he said, “Here I am, Lord.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the Lord said to him: “Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas inquire by name for Saul of Tarsus; because, you see, he is praying,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and placing a hand on him, so that he might recover his sight.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Ananias answered: “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Moreover here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who are calling on Your name.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the Lord said to him: “Get moving, because this man is a chosen vessel to me, to carry my name before nations and kings, also the children of Israel;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Ananias went and entered the house, and placing his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me so that you may recover your sight and be filled by Holy Spirit.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight forthwith; and getting up he was baptized,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and upon receiving food he was strengthened. So Saul was with the disciples in Damascus for a number of days.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately he started proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues, that He is the Son of the God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well, all who heard him were astounded and started saying: “Isn't this the one who tried to destroy, in Jerusalem, those who called on this name? Even here he had come with that purpose, that he might take them bound to the high priests.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Saul kept growing stronger and kept on confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus, proving that ‘This One is the Christ.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when a good many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but their plot became known to Saul. They started watching the gates day and night, so that they might kill him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >so the disciples took him by night and passed him through the wall, lowering him in a hamper.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now upon arriving in Jerusalem Saul kept trying to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Barnabas took him in tow and brought him to the apostles, and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken fearlessly in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he was with them in Jerusalem, going in and out, and speaking fearlessly in the name of Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He kept on speaking and debating with the Hellenists, so they started trying to kill him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon finding it out, the brothers brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So then the congregations throughout all Judea and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace and were built up; and proceeding in the fear of the Lord and in the enabling of the Holy Spirit they were being multiplied.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now it happened, as Peter went through all those parts, that he also went down to the saints who were living in Lydda.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And there he found a certain man named Aeneas who was paralyzed—he had been lying on a pallet for eight years.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Peter said to him: “Aeneas, Jesus the Messiah is healing you. Get up and make your bed!” And immediately he stood up!</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now there was a certain disciple in Joppa named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds that she kept doing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But it happened in those days that she took sick and died; so when they had washed her they placed her in the upper room.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now Lydda was near Joppa; the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent to him imploring him not to delay in coming to them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Peter got up and went with them; upon arriving they took him up to the upper room; all the widows stood around him weeping and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas was making while she was with them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Peter put them all out, kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body he said, “Tabitha, get up!” So she opened her eyes, and upon seeing Peter she sat up.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he gave her a hand and lifted her up, and calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >About the ninth hour of the day, in a vision, he saw clearly an angel of God entering his presence and saying to him, “Cornelius!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well, staring at him and being frightened he said, “What is it, Lord?” So he said to him: “Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who were faithful to him,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and explaining everything to them he sent them to Joppa.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now on the next day, as they were traveling and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well he became hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were preparing, a trance fell on him,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and he saw the heaven opened and a container like a great sheet descending to him—it was tied at the four corners and was being let down to the earth—</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth (both wild animals and reptiles) and birds of the sky.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then a voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Peter said: “No way, Lord! Never have I eaten anything ‘common’ or unclean!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the voice came to him a second time, “What (pl) God has made clean you must not call ‘common’!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well this happened three times, and then the object was taken back up into the sky.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now as Peter was really perplexed within himself as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, well the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having inquired and found Simon's house, stood before the gate,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and calling out they inquired whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was staying there as a guest.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So as Peter was pondering the vision the Spirit said to him: “Listen, some men are looking for you;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >so get up and go downstairs; and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So going down to the men Peter said: “Yes, I am the one you are looking for. For what reason have you come?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they said: “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by an angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he invited them in and put them up. The next day Peter set out with them, also some of the brothers from Joppa went with him;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So when Peter actually arrived, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet and worshiped.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Peter lifted him up, saying: “Stand up! I myself am also a man.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And conversing with him he went in and found many gathered there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he said to them: “You know how it is unlawful for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a different race; but God has shown me that I should not call any man ‘common’ or unclean.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore also I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. So I ask, for what reason did you send for me?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Cornelius said: “I have been fasting during four days until this very hour; yes, it was the ninth hour, I was praying in my house when wow, a man stood before me in shining clothing</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said: ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms are remembered before God.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So I sent to you at once, and you did well to come. Now then, we are all present before God to hear all the things commanded you by God.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So opening his mouth Peter said: “Really, I comprehend that God is not One to show partiality,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Peter began by explaining it to them in order, saying:</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“I was in the town of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain object like a great sheet coming down out of the sky, being lowered by its four corners; and it came to me.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon peering into it I observed and distinguished the quadrupeds of the earth—both the wild animals and the reptiles—and the birds of the sky.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well this was done three times, and it was all pulled back up into the sky.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >At that very moment three men stopped in front of the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, ‘John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit.’</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon hearing these things they acquiesced and started glorifying God, saying, “So then, God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance into life!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that came about in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well the report concerning them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He then brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they said, “Believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, you and your household.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they spoke the Word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In that same hour of the night he took them aside and washed their wounds, and thereupon he and all his family were baptized.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he brought them into his house and set a meal before them, and he was really rejoicing, having believed in God with his whole family.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when it was day the magistrates sent the officers saying, “Let those men go.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the jailer reported these words to Paul, “The magistrates have sent to release you; so now you can leave and go in peace.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Paul said to them: “After severely beating us in public, although we were uncondemned Romans, they threw us into prison, and now do they toss us out on the sly? No way! Rather, let them come themselves and escort us out!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the officers reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and they came and appealed to them, and leading them out they asked them to leave the city.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So exiting the prison they entered Lydia's place, and upon seeing the brothers they encouraged them and departed.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Paul, as was his custom, went in to them and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >explaining and demonstrating that the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and that “this Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Messiah.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of devout Greeks and not a few of the prominent women.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the disobedient Jews rounded up some wicked men from the marketplace, and forming a mob they created an uproar in the city; and attacking the house of Jason, they wanted to bring them out to the crowd.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But not finding them they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials vociferating: “These who have upset the whole world have come here too,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >to whom Jason has given lodging. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king—Jesus.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well they agitated the crowd and the city officials when they heard these things.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then they took a security bond from Jason and the rest and let them go.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Immediately, during the night, the brothers sent both Paul and Silas away to Berea; on arriving they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all goodwill, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things might be so.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the Word of God was also being proclaimed by Paul in Berea, they came too, agitating the crowds.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So then, without delay, the brothers sent Paul away, as if to go by sea, while both Silas and Timothy remained there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But those who were conducting Paul actually took him all the way to Athens; and receiving a command to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they started back.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was increasingly aroused within him as he observed that the city was full of idols.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he reasoned both in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then certain philosophers, both Epicureans and Stoics, encountered him. Some said, “What might this idea-scavenger want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So taking him in tow they led him to the Areopagus and said: “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Because you are bringing some strange things to our ears, and we would like to know what they might mean.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >(Now all Athenians and resident foreigners spent their time in nothing else but to tell, or else to hear, some novelty.)</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So standing in the middle of the Areopagus Paul said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because as I went along and scrutinized the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO UNKNOWN GOD.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And from one blood He made every ethnic nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >so that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because in Him we live and move and have our being. As also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divinity is like gold or silver or stone—something shaped by human skill and imagination.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Such times of ignorance God did indeed overlook, but now He commands all people everywhere to repent,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because He has appointed a day in which He will judge the inhabited world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained; He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some started scoffing, while others said, “We will hear you again about this.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And with that Paul went out from among them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >However some men believed and joined him, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, also a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now after these things Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And encountering a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome), he joined them;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and because he practiced the same trade, he stayed on with them and worked (their trade was tentmaker).</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Every Sabbath in the synagogue he would reason with both Jews and Greeks, trying to persuade them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the Spirit, solemnly insisting to the Jews: Jesus is the Christ.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But since they kept contradicting and blaspheming, he shook his clothes and said to them: “Your blood be upon your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he moved from there into the house of a man named Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household; and as they were hearing, many of the Corinthians were believing and being baptized.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the Lord said to Paul by a vision at night: “Do not be afraid; rather speak and do not keep silent,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >because I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you, because I have many people in this city.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he stayed on for a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If there really was some misdeed or wicked crime, O Jews, there would be reason for me to bear with you;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but since it is an issue over a word and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; because I refuse to be a judge of such matters.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he drove them from the judgment seat.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But none of this was a delay to Gallio.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Paul still remained there a good while, then took leave of the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila (he had shaved his head in Cenchrea, because he had a vow).</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He came to Ephesus and left them there (after having entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews).</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >rather he took leave of them saying, “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church [in Jerusalem], he returned to Antioch.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, mighty in the Scriptures, arrived in Ephesus.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” So they said to him, “But we have not so much as heard that there is a Holy Spirit!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” So they said, “Into John's baptism.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Paul said, “John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into the One who would come after him, that is, into Jesus, the Christ.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So upon hearing this they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And as Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they started speaking languages and prophesying.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >During three months Paul kept going to the synagogue and speaking boldly, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the Kingdom of God.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when some became hardened and disobedient, maligning the Way before the crowd, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now this continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the Word of the Lord Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Further, God kept working unusual miracles by the hands of Paul,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that he touched were applied to the sick, and the diseases left them and the wicked spirits went out from them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well some among the itinerant Jewish exorcists attempted to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits saying, “We adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In fact there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who were doing this.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But a particular wicked spirit reacted and said, “Jesus I know, and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the man in whom the wicked spirit was jumped on them and overpowered them; he was so much stronger that they ran out of that house naked and wounded.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being exalted.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And many of those who had believed started coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In fact, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them up, in front of everybody (they had calculated their value and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver).</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And you observe and hear that not only in Ephesus but throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that handmade things are not gods.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now upon hearing this they were filled with anger and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not let him.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The assembly was in confusion: some were shouting one thing and some another; most of them did not know why they had come together.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And now I stand here being judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >to which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. It is because of this hope that I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“However, I myself thought that I had to perpetrate many things in opposition to the name of Jesus the Natsorean;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >I actually did this in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Yes, I punished them often in every synagogue, trying to force them to blaspheme; I was so excessively enraged against them that I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“It was on one of those journeys, as I was going to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >at midday, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun, blazing around me and those traveling with me.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well we all fell to the ground and I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And He said: ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now get up and stand on your feet; because I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and a witness both of the things you have seen and of the things I will reveal to you,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >—first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, then to all the region of Judea and to the ethnic nations, I still preach: ‘repent and turn back to God, doing works worthy of repentance.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >That is why the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So then, having experienced the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying to both small and great, saying nothing beyond what both the prophets and Moses said would happen</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice: “Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he said: “I am not crazy, most excellent Festus; rather I pronounce words of truth and reasonableness.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For the king knows about these things, before whom I speak freely; for I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, since it was not done in a corner.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Agrippa said to Paul, “You will soon persuade me to become a Christian!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Paul said, “Whether sooner or later, I would to God that not only you but also all who are hearing me this day may become such as I am, except for these chains.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon his saying this, the king stood up, along with the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the imperial cohort.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So we embarked in a ship of Atramytium, being about to sail to points along the Asian coast, and we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The next day we landed at Sidon; Julius treated Paul kindly and permitted him to go to his friends and receive care.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And when we had sailed across the sea that is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When we had sailed slowly many days and scarcely arrived opposite Cnidus, the wind did not allow us to go forward, so we sailed for the lee of Crete by way of Salmone;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >sailing along it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Much time had been lost and sailing was already dangerous, because even the Fast had already taken place; Paul repeatedly warned them</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >saying, “Men, I perceive that the voyage is about to be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but even of our lives.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and ship owner rather than by what Paul said.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And since the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised sailing on, to see if they could get to Phoenix in order to winter, it being a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But not long after, a cyclonic wind blasted down from the land (it is called Euroclydon).</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well the ship was caught and could not head into the wind, so we gave up and were driven along.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we barely managed to secure the skiff;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >when they had hoisted it aboard, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing that they might fall into the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven along.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >We were being so violently battered by the storm that the next day they began to jettison things,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and on the third we threw off the ship's tackle with our own hands.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a major storm was still pounding us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now after long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said: “Well men, it would have been better to take my advice and not sail from Crete, only to ‘gain’ this damage and loss.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But now I urge you to take heart, because there will be no loss of life among you, only of the ship.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >This night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said: ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. Furthermore, God has granted you all those who sail with you.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So take courage, men, because I believe in God that it will be just as it was told me.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Also, we must run aground on a certain island.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven here and there in the Adriatic, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were nearing some land.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They took a sounding and found twenty fathoms; going on a little they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So fearing that we might be driven into a rocky area, they dropped four anchors from the stern and started praying for day to come.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow, the sailors lowered the skiff into the sea, intending to flee from the ship;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >so Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, “Unless these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the soldiers severed the ropes of the skiff and let it fall away.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >While the day was coming on, Paul started urging them all to receive food, saying: “Today is the fourteenth day of waiting—you continue without eating, having taken nothing.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, because this is for our survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Upon saying this he picked up some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all; then he broke it and began to eat.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they all were encouraged and took food themselves.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >(In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.)</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So when they had eaten enough, they started lightening the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship, if possible.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Casting off the anchors they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But they fell into a place where two seas met and ran the vessel aground; the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to be broken up by the violence of the waves.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the plan of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, stopped them from doing it and ordered those who could swim to jump in first and go toward the land,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>44 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >followed by the rest, some on planks and some on things from the ship. And in this way they all escaped safely to the land.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the natives showed us unusual kindness, in that they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, because of the heat a viper came out and fastened itself on his hand.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But he just shook the beast off into the fire and suffered no harm.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well they were expecting him to swell up, or suddenly fall down dead; but after waiting for quite a while and seeing nothing unusual happening to him, they changed their mind and started saying he was a god.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now in that region there were properties belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and in a friendly manner took care of us for three days.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well it happened that the father of Publius was sick in bed with fever and dysentery; Paul went in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So, when this had happened, the rest of those on the island who had diseases started coming and being healed;</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now after three months we put to sea in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered in the island, whose figurehead was ‘the Twin Brothers’.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days;</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >from there we tacked back and forth and arrived at Rhegium. After one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >where we found brothers who urged us to stay there seven days—that was how we went toward Rome.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And the brothers there, when they heard about our circumstances, came out to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them he thanked God and took courage.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now when we entered Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander; but Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >It happened that after three days Paul called together the leaders of the Jews; and when they had assembled he said to them: “Men, brothers, though I had done nothing against ‘the people’ or the ancestral customs, still I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >who, when they had examined me, were intending to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar; not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For this reason therefore I asked to see you and speak with you; it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they said to him: “We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came reported or spoken any evil about you.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So arranging a day with him, even more people came to him at his lodging, to whom he kept expounding from morning until evening: solemnly testifying about the Kingdom of God and trying to convince them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Well some were persuaded by what had been said, and some kept refusing to believe.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So being in disagreement among themselves they started to leave, after Paul had said this one word: “The Holy Spirit spoke correctly to our fathers through Isaiah the prophet,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >as it is written: “He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little.”</span></span>

<p>The Aionian Bible republishes public domain and Creative Common Bible texts that are 100% free to copy and print. The original translation is unaltered and notes are added to help your study. The notes show the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>Who has the authority to interpret the Bible and examine the underlying Hebrew and Greek words? That is a good question! We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:27</a>, <i>"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."</i> Every Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible! Now that does not mean we will all agree. Each of us is still growing in our understanding of the truth. However, it does mean that there is no infallible human or tradition to answer all our questions. Instead the Holy Spirit helps each of us to know the truth and grow closer to God and each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is a library with 66 books in the Protestant Canon. The best way to learn God’s word is to read entire books. Read the book of Genesis. Read the book of <a title='View Reference' href='?John'				onclick="ABDO('John');				return false;">John</a>. Read the entire Bible library. Topical studies and cross-referencing can be good. However, the safest way to understand context and meaning is to read whole Bible books. Chapter and verse numbers were added for convenience in the 16th century, but unfortunately they can cause the Bible to seem like an encyclopedia. The Aionian Bible is formatted with simple verse numbering, minimal notes, and no cross-referencing in order to encourage the reading of Bible books.</p>

<p>Bible reading must also begin with prayer. Any Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible with God’s help. However, this freedom is also a responsibility because without the Holy Spirit we cannot interpret accurately. We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-2'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-2');	return false;">1 Corinthians 2:13-14</a>, <i>"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."</i> So we cannot understand in our natural self, but we can with God’s help through prayer.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the best writer and he uses literary devices such as introductions, conclusions, paragraphs, and metaphors. He also writes various genres including historical narrative, prose, and poetry. So Bible study must spiritually discern and understand literature. Pray, read, observe, interpret, and apply. Finally, <i>"Do your best to present yourself approved by God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth."</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Timothy-2'		onclick="ABDO('2-Timothy-2');		return false;">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <i>"God has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-1'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-1');		return false;">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>.</p>

<p><a href="?Maps" title="Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Bible maps" onclick="ABDO('Maps');return false;">Middle Eastern and Mediterranean maps</a> and 

<a href="?Past" title="Bible timelines and Church history charts" onclick="ABDO('Past');return false;">Bible timelines and Church history charts</a> are also available to help your study.</p>

<h3><i><a id="g1653">eleēsē</a></i></h3>
Language: Koine Greek<br>
Speech: verb<br>
Strongs: g1653<br>
Meaning:<br><div style='margin-left: 15px;'>To have pity on, to show mercy. Typically, the subjunctive mood indicates possiblity, not certainty. However, a subjunctive in a purpose clause is a resulting action as certain as the causal action. The subjunctive in a purpose clause functions as an indicative, not an optative. Thus, the grand conclusion of grace theology in Romans 11:32 must be clarified. God's mercy on all is not a possibility, but a certainty. See <a href='https://www.ntgreek.org' target='_blank'>www.ntgreek.org</a>.</div>
Usage: 1 time in this conjugation, Romans 11:32<br>

<p>The Aionian Bible shows the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian Glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;">Aionian Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of after-life destinies. The underlying Hebrew and Greek words typically translated as <i>Hell</i> show us that there are not just two after-life destinies, Heaven or Hell.  Instead, there are a number of different locations, each with different purposes, different durations, and different inhabitants. Locations include 1) Old Testament <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i>Sheol</i></a> and New Testament <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i>Hadēs</i></a>, 2) <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i>Geenna</i></a>, 3) <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i>Tartaroō</i></a>, 4) <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i>Abyssos</i></a>, 5) <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i>Limnē Pyr</i></a>, 6) <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Paradise</a>, 7) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Heaven</a>, and 8) <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">The New Earth</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The key observation is that fallen angels will be present at the final judgment, <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a> and  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>. Traditionally, we understand the separation of the Sheep and the Goats at the final judgment to divide believing from unbelieving mankind, <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:31-46</a> and <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. However, the presence of fallen angels alternatively suggests that Jesus is separating redeemed mankind from the fallen angels.  We do know that Jesus is the helper of mankind and not the helper of the Devil, <a title='View Reference' href='?Hebrews-2'			onclick="ABDO('Hebrews-2');		return false;">Hebrews 2</a>. We also know that Jesus has atoned for the sins of all mankind, both believer and unbeliever alike, <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:1-2</a>. Deceased believers are rewarded in Paradise, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Luke 23:43</a>, while unbelievers are punished in Hades as the story of Lazarus makes plain, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-16'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-16');			return false;">Luke 16:19-31</a>. Yet less commonly known, the punishment of this selfish man and all unbelievers is before the final judgment, is temporal, and is punctuated when Hades is evacuated, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>. So is there hope beyond Hades for unbelieving mankind? Jesus promised, <i>“the gates of Hades will not prevail,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-16'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-16');		return false;">Matthew 16:18</a>. Paul asks, <i>“Hades where is your victory?”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-15'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-15');	return false;">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>. John wrote, <i>“Hades gives up,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus comforts us saying, <i>“Do not be afraid,”</i> because he holds the keys to <i>unlock</i> death and Hades, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-1'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-1');		return false;">Revelation 1:18</a>. Yet too often our <i>Good News</i> sounds like a warning to <i>“be afraid”</i> because Jesus holds the keys to <i>lock</i> Hades!  Wow, we have it backwards!  Hades will be evacuated!  And to guarrantee hope, once emptied, Hades is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never needed again, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we read that anyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life is thrown into the Lake of Fire, the second death, with no exit ever mentioned or promised, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">Revelation 21:1-8</a>. So are those evacuated from Hades then, <i>“out of the frying pan, into the fire?”</i>  Certainly, the Lake of Fire is the destiny of the Goats.  But, do not be afraid. Instead, read the Bible's explicit mention of the purpose of the Lake of Fire and the identity of the Goats. <i>“Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the consummate fire which is prepared for... the devil and his angels,’”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>. Bad news for the Devil. Good news for all mankind!</p>

<p>Faith is not a pen to write your own name in the Book of Life. Instead, faith is the glasses to see that the love of Christ for all mankind has already written our names in Heaven. Jesus said, <i>“You did not choose me, but I chose you,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?John-15'			onclick="ABDO('John-15');			return false;">John 15:16</a>.  Though unbelievers will suffer regrettable punishment in Hades, redeemed mankind will never enter the Lake of Fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And as God promised, all mankind will worship Christ together forever, <a title='View Reference' href='?Philippians-2'		onclick="ABDO('Philippians-2');	return false;">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.</p>
