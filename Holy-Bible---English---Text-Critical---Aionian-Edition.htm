<p>This a Progressive Web App (PWA) format of one <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>. PWAs are special webpages designed to install an App icon and be available offline on a smart device if an Internet connection is not available. Visit <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Read' target='_blank' title='Select from all AionianBible.org translations'>AionianBible.org</a> for all Bibles.</p>

<p>The  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition®</i>  is the world’s first Bible <i>un-translation</i>!  What is an  <i>un-translation</i>?  Bibles are translated into each of our languages from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.  Occasionally, the best word translation cannot be found and these words are transliterated letter by letter.  Four well known transliterations are  <i>Christ</i>,  <i>baptism</i>,  <i>angel</i>, and  <i>apostle</i>.  The meaning is then preserved more accurately through context and a dictionary.  The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible un-translates and instead transliterates eleven additional <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>The first three words are  <a href="?Glossary#g165" title="Aionian glossary g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g166" title="Aionian glossary g166" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g166');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g126" title="Aionian glossary g126" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g126');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i></a>,  typically translated as  <i>eternal</i>  and also  <i>world</i>  or  <i>eon</i>. The  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible is named after an alternative spelling of  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>. Consider that researchers question if  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  and  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  actually mean <i>eternal</i>. Translating  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  as <i>eternal</i> in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-28'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-28');		return false;">Matthew 28:20</a>  makes no sense, as all agree. The Greek word for eternal is  <i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i>, used in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-1'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-1');			return false;">Romans 1:20</a>  about God and in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>  about demon imprisonment. Yet what about  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>? Certainly we do not question whether salvation is eternal! However,  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  means something much more wonderful than infinite time! Ancient Greeks used  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  to mean eon or age. They also used the adjective  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  to mean entirety, such as  <i>complete</i>  or even <i>consummate</i>, but never infinite time. Read <a href="?Aionian" title="Aiōn and Aiōnios" onclick="ABDO('Aionian');return false;">Dr. Heleen Keizer and Ramelli and Konstan</a> for proofs. So  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  is the perfect description of God's Word which has  <i>everything</i>  we need for life and godliness! And the  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  life promised in  <a title='View Reference' href='?John-3'				onclick="ABDO('John-3');			return false;">John 3:16</a>  is not simply a ticket to eternal life in the future, but the invitation through faith to the  <i>consummate</i>  life beginning now!  <i class='notranslate'>Aiōnios</i>  life with Christ is <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Buy#Better' target='_blank'><i>Better than Forever</i></a>.</p>

<p>The next seven words are  <a href="?Glossary#h7585" title="Aionian glossary h7585" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','h7585');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g86" title="Aionian glossary g86" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g86');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g1067" title="Aionian glossary g1067" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1067');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g5020" title="Aionian glossary g5020" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g5020');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i></a>,  <a href="?Glossary#g12" title="Aionian glossary g12" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g12');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i></a>, and  <a href="?Glossary#g3041" title="Aionian glossary g3041 g4442" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g3041');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i></a>. These words are often translated as  <i>Hell</i>, the place of eternal punishment. However,  <i>Hell</i>  is ill-defined when compared with the Hebrew and Greek.  For example,  <i class='notranslate'>Sheol</i>  is the abode of deceased believers and unbelievers and should never be translated as  <i>Hell</i>.  <i class='notranslate'>Hadēs</i>  is a temporary place of punishment,  <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Geenna</i>  is the Valley of Hinnom, Jerusalem's refuse dump, a temporal judgment for sin.  <i class='notranslate'>Tartaroō</i>  is a prison for demons, mentioned once in  <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a>.  <i class='notranslate'>Abyssos</i>  is a temporary prison for the Beast and Satan. Translators are also inconsistent because  <i>Hell</i>  is used by the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---King-James-Version' target='_blank' title='King James Version'>King James Version</a>  54 times, the  <a href='https://www.thenivbible.com/' target='_blank' title='New International Version Bible'>New International Version</a>  14 times, and the  <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Bibles/English---World-English-Bible' target='_blank' title='World English Bible'>World English Bible</a>  zero times.  Finally,  <i class='notranslate'>Limnē Pyr</i>  is the Lake of Fire, yet  <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>  explains that these fires are  <a href="?Destiny" title="Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels" onclick="ABDO('Destiny');return false;">prepared for the Devil and his angels</a>. So there is reason to review our conclusions about the destinies of redeemed mankind and fallen angels.</p>

<p>The eleventh word,  <a href="?Glossary#g1653" title="Aionian glossary g1653" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g1653');return false;"><i class='notranslate'>eleēsē</i></a>, reveals the grand conclusion of grace in  <a title='View Reference' href='?Romans-11'			onclick="ABDO('Romans-11');		return false;">Romans 11:32</a>. Take the time to understand these eleven words.  The original translation is unaltered and a highlighted note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses.  Also to help parallel study and <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Enhanced Concordance</a> use, apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard.

<p>Dr. Heleen Keizer wrote <b><i>Life Time Entirety</i></b> to explain the meaning of the Greek word aiōn. She begins, "<i>The Greek word aiōn has a wide ranging meaning as well as a wide ranging history: it is most commonly translated as ‘eternity’ but has as its first meaning ‘life’ or ‘lifetime’; it has its place in Greek literature and philosophy, but also in the Greek Bible, where it represents the Hebrew word ‘olâm.</i>" Her 315 page PhD dissertation shows that the Greek word aiōn originally denotes life time, duration, or complete life, but not eternal. You can read her <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer' target='_blank' title='Visit Dr. Keizers dissertation online'>dissertation online</a> or an <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer-Abstract' target='_blank' title='View an abstract of Dr. Keizers dissertation'>abstract of her conclusions here</a>.</p>

<p>Ilaria Ramelli and David Konstan wrote <b><i>Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts</i></b>, <a href='https://www.aionianbible.org/Terms-for-Eternity-Ramelli-Konstan' target='_blank' title='Purchase Ramelli and Konstan at Amazon.com'>available at Amazon</a>. This highly technical volume quotes hundreds of sources from classical literature, the Septuagint, early church fathers, and church fathers after Origen to determine the meaning and usage of <i>Aiōnios</i> and <i>Aïdios</i>.  They conclude that <i>Aïdios</i> nearly always means eternal in the absolute sense.  <i>Aïdios</i> is used twice in the Bible: Romans 1:20 concerning God and Jude 6 concerning the bonds on fallen angels.  <i>Aiōnios</i>, however, has a range of meanings including life, age, generation, and eon.  They argue that <i>Aiōnios</i> can also mean eternal, but only when God is the subject.  Ramelli and Konstan concur with Keizer and conclude saying, "<i>Needless to say, the ethical implications of this question are profound.</i>"</p>

<p>Every quest for the truth must have the wisdom to eliminate what we prefer to be true and also the courage to eliminate what we fear to be true in order to discover what Christ says is actually true.</p>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the woman was frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, so she came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to her, “Daughter, yoʋr faith has healed yoʋ. Go in peace, and be healed of yoʋr affliction.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he could do no miracles there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And he was amazed at their unbelief. Then Jesus went around among the villages teaching.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no knapsack, no bread, and no copper money in their belts.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He told them to wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He also said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they went out and preached that people should repent.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They also cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the king immediately sent an executioner and commanded that John's head be brought back.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The executioner then went and beheaded John in the prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said the blessing.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>48 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He saw the disciples straining as they rowed, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and intended to pass them by.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>49 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground, and taking the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute, and they set them before the crowd.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They also had a few small fish. After blessing the fish, Jesus told the disciples to set them before the crowd as well.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >There were about four thousand men who had eaten. After sending them away,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus immediately got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, asking him for a sign from heaven, to test him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, “Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he left them, got into the boat again, and went away to the other side of the sea.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had nothing with them in the boat except for one loaf.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus gave them strict orders, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they discussed this with one another, saying, “He must have said this because we have no bread.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts still hardened?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he said to them, “How is it that you do not understand?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Jesus came to Bethsaida, some people brought to him a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on the man's eyes, laid his hands on him, and asked him if he saw anything.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The man looked up and said, “I can see people, but they look like trees walking around.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes again and had him look up. Then the man's sight was restored, and he saw everyone clearly.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Jesus sent him away to his house, saying, “Do not go into the village or tell anyone in the village what has happened.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus went on to the villages of Caesarea Philippi along with his disciples. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They answered, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others say that yoʋ are one of the prophets.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “Yoʋ are the Christ.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He was stating the matter plainly, so Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But turning around and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, “Get behind me, Satan! For yoʋ are not thinking about the things of God, but the things of men.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he called the crowd over, along with his disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel will save it.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But they did not understand what this meant, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house, he asked the disciples, “What were you discussing among yourselves on the way?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said to him, “Tell us, by what authority are yoʋ doing these things, or who is it that gave yoʋ this authority?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He answered them, “I will also ask you one question. Tell me:</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Did John's authority to baptize come from heaven or from men?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they discussed it among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they answered that they did not know where it came from.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and left the country for a long time.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >At harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he proceeded to send another servant, but they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he proceeded to send a third, but they wounded him as well and threw him out.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps when they see him they will have respect for him.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But when they saw him, the farmers discussed it among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>15 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>16 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others.” When the people heard this, they said, “Certainly not!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus looked at them and said, “What then is the meaning of this Scripture: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>19 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the chief priests and the scribes wanted to arrest him at that very hour, for they knew he had spoken this parable against them, but they were afraid.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>20 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be sincere in order to catch him in something he said, so that they could deliver him up to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The spies asked him, “Teacher, we know that yoʋ speak and teach correctly, and that yoʋ do not show partiality but teach the way of God in truth.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>23 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But perceiving their craftiness, Jesus said to them, “Why are you testing me?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?” They answered, “Caesar's.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they were not able to catch him in what he said in the presence of the people. And being amazed at his answer, they fell silent.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>27 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came up and asked Jesus,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>28 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >“Teacher, Moses wrote for us: ‘If a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, that man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>29 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now there were seven brothers. The first married a woman and died childless.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>30 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The second married the widow, and he also died childless.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>31 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Likewise, the third also married her. In the same way all seven died, leaving no children.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Last of all, the woman also died.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >In the resurrection, therefore, which of them will she be the wife of? For the seven all had her as a wife.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex avh' lang='en' >Jesus answered them, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage, <span class='not' dir='ltr'><a href='?67' onclick='ABDO(67);return false;' title='View previous annotation'>&lt;</a> aiōn <a href="?Glossary#g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');	return false;"	title='View definition'>g165</a> <a href='?76' onclick='ABDO(76);return false;' title='View next annotation'>&gt;</a></span></span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex avh' lang='en' >but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are they given in marriage. <span class='not' dir='ltr'><a href='?67' onclick='ABDO(67);return false;' title='View previous annotation'>&lt;</a> aiōn <a href="?Glossary#g165" onclick="ABDO('Glossary','g165');	return false;"	title='View definition'>g165</a> <a href='?76' onclick='ABDO(76);return false;' title='View next annotation'>&gt;</a></span></span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>36 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Indeed they can no longer die, for they are like angels. They are sons of God, since they are sons of the resurrection.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>37 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But even Moses indicated that the dead are raised, when he said in the passage about the burning bush, ‘The Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>38 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>39 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then some of the scribes responded, “Teacher, yoʋ have spoken well.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>40 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And they no longer dared to ask him anything.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>41 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Jesus said to them, “How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David?</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>45 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>63 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody began mocking him and beating him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>64 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They also blindfolded him and kept striking his face, saying to him, “Prophesy! Who is it that struck yoʋ?”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>66 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When daybreak came, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Jesus up to their Sanhedrin and said,</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>1 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then the whole assembly arose and led Jesus to Pilate.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>2 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation and forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, declaring himself to be Christ, a king.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>3 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are yoʋ the king of the Jews?” Jesus answered him, “Yoʋ have said it yoʋrself.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>4 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no fault in this man.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Pilate heard mention of Galilee, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >And when he found out that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When Herod saw Jesus he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard many things about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>9 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So he questioned him at great length, but Jesus gave him no answer.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>10 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Meanwhile, the chief priests and the scribes stood there, vehemently accusing him.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>11 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Herod also treated him with contempt and mocked him, as did his soldiers. Then, after dressing Jesus in fine clothing, Herod sent him back to Pilate.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>12 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with one another; before this they had been enemies.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>13 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>14 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people.

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>17 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now each year at the feast Pilate was obligated to release one prisoner for the people.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>18 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So they all cried out together, “Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >but they kept on shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >A third time he said to them, “Why? What evil has he done? I have found in him no grounds for death. So I will have him flogged and then release him.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>24 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >So Pilate rendered his decision that their demand be granted.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>25 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >He released the man they had been asking for, who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he handed Jesus over to their will.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>26 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >As the soldiers led him away, they took hold of Simon, a Cyrenian man who was coming in from the countryside, and they laid on him the cross, forcing him to carry it behind Jesus.</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>32 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now two others, who were criminals, were also being led away to be put to death with Jesus.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>33 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >When they came to the place called the Skull, the soldiers crucified him there along with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>34 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Then they cast lots to divide his garments.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>35 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >The people stood there looking on, and the rulers who were with them ridiculed him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ, the Chosen One of God.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>42 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Then he said to Jesus, “Remember me, Lord, when yoʋ come in yoʋr kingdom.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>43 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to yoʋ, today yoʋ will be with me in Paradise.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>5 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you because you perform the works of the law or because you hear with faith?</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>6 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Remember, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>7 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Therefore you must understand that those who have faith are the sons of Abraham.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>8 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Now the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the nations will be blessed in yoʋ.”</span></span>

<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>21 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, truly righteousness would have come through the law.</span></span>
<span class='ff ver' lang='en' ><span class='num'>22 </span><span class='ff tex' lang='en' >But the Scripture has confined all under sin, so that the promise might be given on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe.</span></span>

<p>The Aionian Bible republishes public domain and Creative Common Bible texts that are 100% free to copy and print. The original translation is unaltered and notes are added to help your study. The notes show the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;"><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.</p>

<p>Who has the authority to interpret the Bible and examine the underlying Hebrew and Greek words? That is a good question! We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:27</a>, <i>"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."</i> Every Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible! Now that does not mean we will all agree. Each of us is still growing in our understanding of the truth. However, it does mean that there is no infallible human or tradition to answer all our questions. Instead the Holy Spirit helps each of us to know the truth and grow closer to God and each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is a library with 66 books in the Protestant Canon. The best way to learn God’s word is to read entire books. Read the book of Genesis. Read the book of <a title='View Reference' href='?John'				onclick="ABDO('John');				return false;">John</a>. Read the entire Bible library. Topical studies and cross-referencing can be good. However, the safest way to understand context and meaning is to read whole Bible books. Chapter and verse numbers were added for convenience in the 16th century, but unfortunately they can cause the Bible to seem like an encyclopedia. The Aionian Bible is formatted with simple verse numbering, minimal notes, and no cross-referencing in order to encourage the reading of Bible books.</p>

<p>Bible reading must also begin with prayer. Any Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible with God’s help. However, this freedom is also a responsibility because without the Holy Spirit we cannot interpret accurately. We read in <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-2'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-2');	return false;">1 Corinthians 2:13-14</a>, <i>"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."</i> So we cannot understand in our natural self, but we can with God’s help through prayer.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the best writer and he uses literary devices such as introductions, conclusions, paragraphs, and metaphors. He also writes various genres including historical narrative, prose, and poetry. So Bible study must spiritually discern and understand literature. Pray, read, observe, interpret, and apply. Finally, <i>"Do your best to present yourself approved by God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth."</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Timothy-2'		onclick="ABDO('2-Timothy-2');		return false;">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <i>"God has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-1'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-1');		return false;">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>.</p>

<p><a href="?Maps" title="Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Bible maps" onclick="ABDO('Maps');return false;">Middle Eastern and Mediterranean maps</a> and 

<a href="?Past" title="Bible timelines and Church history charts" onclick="ABDO('Past');return false;">Bible timelines and Church history charts</a> are also available to help your study.</p>

<p>The <i>Aionian Bible</i> un-translates and instead transliterates eleven special words to help us better understand the extent of God’s love for individuals and all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.  The original translation is unaltered and a note is added to 64 Old Testament and 200 New Testament verses. Compare the definitions below to the <a href='https://www.AionianBible.org/Strongs' target='_blank' title='Strongs Enhanced Concordance and Glossary'>Strong's Concordance</a>.

<h3><i><a id="g1653">eleēsē</a></i></h3>
Language: Koine Greek<br>
Speech: verb<br>
Strongs: g1653<br>
Meaning:<br><div style='margin-left: 15px;'>To have pity on, to show mercy. Typically, the subjunctive mood indicates possiblity, not certainty. However, a subjunctive in a purpose clause is a resulting action as certain as the causal action. The subjunctive in a purpose clause functions as an indicative, not an optative. Thus, the grand conclusion of grace theology in Romans 11:32 must be clarified. God's mercy on all is not a possibility, but a certainty.

Note that the punishment of deceased unbelieving mankind in Hades is temporal as promised when Jesus said <i>“the gates of Hades will not prevail”</i>, Paul wrote <i>“Hades where is your victory?”</i>, and John wrote <i>“Hades gives up.”</i>  Also note that certain fallen angels are already held in a separate prison, Tartarus, awaiting final judgment and sentencing to the Lake of Fire which is <i>“prepared for the Devil and his angels,”</i> according to Matthew 25:41.  Satan’s rebellion will be crushed and Christ will be victorious in the salvation of all his people.

<p>The Aionian Bible shows the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew <a href="?Glossary" title="Aionian Glossary" onclick="ABDO('Glossary');return false;">Aionian Glossary</a> words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of after-life destinies. The underlying Hebrew and Greek words typically translated as <i>Hell</i> show us that there are not just two after-life destinies, Heaven or Hell.  Instead, there are a number of different locations, each with different purposes, different durations, and different inhabitants.

<p>The key observation is that fallen angels will be present at the final judgment, <a title='View Reference' href='?2-Peter-2'			onclick="ABDO('2-Peter-2');		return false;">2 Peter 2:4</a> and  <a title='View Reference' href='?Jude-1'				onclick="ABDO('Jude-1');			return false;">Jude 6</a>. Traditionally, we understand the separation of the Sheep and the Goats at the final judgment to divide believing from unbelieving mankind, <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:31-46</a> and <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. However, the presence of fallen angels alternatively suggests that Jesus is separating redeemed mankind from the fallen angels.  We do know that Jesus is the helper of mankind and not the helper of the Devil, <a title='View Reference' href='?Hebrews-2'			onclick="ABDO('Hebrews-2');		return false;">Hebrews 2</a>. We also know that Jesus has atoned for the sins of all mankind, both believer and unbeliever alike, <a title='View Reference' href='?1-John-2'			onclick="ABDO('1-John-2');			return false;">1 John 2:1-2</a>. Deceased believers are rewarded in Paradise, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-23'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-23');			return false;">Luke 23:43</a>, while unbelievers are punished in Hades as the story of Lazarus makes plain, <a title='View Reference' href='?Luke-16'			onclick="ABDO('Luke-16');			return false;">Luke 16:19-31</a>. Yet less commonly known, the punishment of this selfish man and all unbelievers is before the final judgment, is temporal, and is punctuated when Hades is evacuated, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>. So is there hope beyond Hades for unbelieving mankind? Jesus promised, <i>“the gates of Hades will not prevail,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-16'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-16');		return false;">Matthew 16:18</a>. Paul asks, <i>“Hades where is your victory?”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?1-Corinthians-15'	onclick="ABDO('1-Corinthians-15');	return false;">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>. John wrote, <i>“Hades gives up,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus comforts us saying, <i>“Do not be afraid,”</i> because he holds the keys to <i>unlock</i> death and Hades, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-1'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-1');		return false;">Revelation 1:18</a>. Yet too often our <i>Good News</i> sounds like a warning to <i>“be afraid”</i> because Jesus holds the keys to <i>lock</i> Hades!  Wow, we have it backwards!  Hades will be evacuated!  And to guarrantee hope, once emptied, Hades is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never needed again, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-20'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-20');	return false;">Revelation 20:13-14</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we read that anyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life is thrown into the Lake of Fire, the second death, with no exit ever mentioned or promised, <a title='View Reference' href='?Revelation-21'		onclick="ABDO('Revelation-21');	return false;">Revelation 21:1-8</a>. So are those evacuated from Hades then, <i>“out of the frying pan, into the fire?”</i>  Certainly, the Lake of Fire is the destiny of the Goats.  But, do not be afraid. Instead, read the Bible's explicit mention of the purpose of the Lake of Fire and the identity of the Goats. <i>“Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the consummate fire which is prepared for... the devil and his angels,’”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?Matthew-25'			onclick="ABDO('Matthew-25');		return false;">Matthew 25:41</a>. Bad news for the Devil. Good news for all mankind!</p>

<p>Faith is not a pen to write your own name in the Book of Life. Instead, faith is the glasses to see that the love of Christ for all mankind has already written our names in Heaven. Jesus said, <i>“You did not choose me, but I chose you,”</i> <a title='View Reference' href='?John-15'			onclick="ABDO('John-15');			return false;">John 15:16</a>.  Though unbelievers will suffer regrettable punishment in Hades, redeemed mankind will never enter the Lake of Fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And as God promised, all mankind will worship Christ together forever, <a title='View Reference' href='?Philippians-2'		onclick="ABDO('Philippians-2');	return false;">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.</p>
